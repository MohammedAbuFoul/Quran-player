    <TD>170. And when it is said to them, `Follow that which ALLAH has sent 
      down, they say, `Nay, we will follow that wherein we found our fathers.' 
      What ! even if their fathers had no sense at all and followed not the 
      right path.<BR>171. And the case of those who disbelieve is like the case 
      of one who shouts to that which hears naught but a call and a cry. They 
      are deaf dumb and blind - so they do not understand. <BR>172. O ye who 
      believe, eat of the good things WE have provided for you, and render 
      thanks to ALLAH, if it is HE Whom you really worship. <BR>173. HE has made 
      unlawful to you only that which dies of itself, and blood and the flesh of 
      swine, and that on which the name of any other than ALLAH has been 
      invoked. But he who is driven by necessity, being neither disobedient nor 
      exceeding the limit, it shall be no sin for him. Surely, ALLAH is most 
      Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>174. Those who hide that which ALLAH has sent 
      down of the Book and take in exchange for it a paltry price, they fill 
      their bellies with nothing but fire. ALLAH will not speak to them on the 
      Day of Resurrection, nor will HE purify them. And for them is a grievous 
      punishment.<BR>175. It is they who have bought error for guidance and 
      punishment for forgiveness. How great is their endurance of the Fire ! 
      <BR>176. That is because ALLAH has sent down the Book with the truth; and 
      surely they who disagree concerning the Book are gone far in 
    enmity.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
