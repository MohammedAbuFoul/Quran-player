    <TD>23. No intercession avails with HIM, except of him whom HE permits it, 
      until when the hearts of those who are granted permission to intercede are 
      relieved of awe, others would say, `What is that your Lord said ?' They 
      will answer, `The truth.' And HE is the High, the Great. <BR>24. Say, `Who 
      gives you sustenance from the heavens and the earth ?' Say, `ALLAH. Either 
      WE or you are on right guidance or in manifest error. <BR>25. Say, `You 
      will not be questioned as to our sins, nor shall we be questioned as to 
      what you do.' <BR>26. Say, `Our Lord will bring us all together, then HE 
      will judge between us with truth, and HE is the Best Judge, the 
      All-Knowing.' <BR>27. Say, `Show me those whom you have joined with HIM as 
      associates.' Nay ! that cannot be, for HE is ALLAH, the Mighty, the Wise. 
      <BR>28. And WE have not sent thee but as a bearer of glad tidings and a 
      Warner for all mankind, but most men know not. <BR>29. And they say, `When 
      will this promise be fulfilled, if you are truthful ?' <BR>30. Say, `For 
      you is the promise of a day from which you cannot remain behind a single 
      moment, nor can you get ahead of it.' <BR>31. And those who disbelieve 
      say, `We will never believe in this Qur'an nor in what is before it.' 
      Couldst thou but see when the wrongdoers will be made to stand before 
      their Lord, casting the blame on one another ? Those who were deemed weak 
      will say to those who were arrogant, `Had it not been for you, we should, 
      surely, have been believers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
