    <TD>138. And WE brought the Children of Israel across the sea and they 
      came to a people who were devoted to their idols. They said, `O Moses, 
      make for us a god just as they have gods.' He said, `Surely you are an 
      ignorant people. <BR>139. `Surely, all that these people are engaged in 
      shall be destroyed, and vain shall be all that they do.' <BR>140. He said, 
      `Shall I seek for you a god other than ALLAH, while HE has exalted you 
      above all peoples ?' <BR>141. And remember the time when WE delivered you 
      from Pharaoh's people who afflicted you with grievous torment, 
      slaughtering your sons and sparing your women. And therein was a great 
      trial for you from your Lord. <BR>142. And WE made Moses a promise of 
      thirty nights and supplemented them with ten. Thus the period appointed by 
      his Lord was completed - forty nights. And Moses said to his brother, 
      Aaron, `Take my place amongst my people in my absence, and manage them 
      well and follow not the way of the mischief-makers.' <BR>143. And when 
      Moses came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, `My 
      Lord, show Thyself to me that I may look at Thee.' ALLAH replied, `Thou 
      shalt not see ME. But look at the mountain; and if it remains in its 
      place, then thou shalt see ME.' And when his Lord manifested Himself on 
      the mountain, HE broke it into pieces and Moses fell down unconscious. And 
      when he recovered, he said, `Holy art Thou, I turn to thee and I am the 
      first to believe.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
