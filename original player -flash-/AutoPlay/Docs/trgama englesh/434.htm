    <TD>49. Say, `The truth has come and falsehood could neither originate 
      anything, nor reproduce it' <BR>50. Say, If I err, I err only against 
      myself; and if I am rightly guided, it is because of what my Lord revealed 
      to me. Verily, HE is All-Hearing, Nigh.' <BR>51. Couldst thou but see when 
      they will be smitten with fear ? Then there will be no escape, and they 
      will be seized from a place nearby. <BR>52. And they will say, `We now 
      believe therein.' But how can they attain faith from a position so far off 
      ? <BR>53. They had disbelieved in it before, while they indulged in 
      conjectures with regard to the unseen from a far off-place. <BR>54. And a 
      barrier will be placed between them and that which they long for, as was 
      done with the like of them before. They too were in disquieting doubt.

      1. All praise belongs to ALLAH, the originator of the heavens and the 
      earth, Who employs the angels as Messengers, having wings, two, three, and 
      four. HE adds to HIS creation whatever HE pleases; for ALLAH has power 
      over all things. <BR>2. Whatever sources of mercy ALLAH lays open for 
      mankind -there is none to withhold them; and whatever of such sources HE 
      withholds, there is none who can release them after that; and HE is the 
      Mighty, the Wise. <BR>3. O ye men, remember the favour of ALLAH that HE 
      has bestowed upon you. Is there any creator other than ALLAH who provides 
      for you from the heaven and the earth ? There is none worthy of worship 
      but HE. Wither then are you turned away
