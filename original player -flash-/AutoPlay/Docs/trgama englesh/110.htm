    <TD>14. And from those also who say, `We are Christians,' WE took a 
      covenant, but they too have forgotten a good part of that with which they 
      were exhorted. So WE have caused enmity and hatred among them till the Day 
      of Resurrection. And ALLAH will soon let them know what they have been 
      doing. <BR>15. O People of the Book ! there has come to you Our Messenger 
      who makes clear to you much of what you have kept hidden of the Book and 
      forgives many of your faults. There has come to you indeed from ALLAH a 
      Light and a clear Book. <BR>16. Thereby does ALLAH guide those who seek 
      His pleasure on the paths of peace, and leads them out of every kind of 
      darkness into light by HIS Will and guides them to the right path. <BR>17. 
      They indeed have disbelieved who say, `Surely ALLAH - He is the Messiah, 
      son of Mary.' Say, `Who then has any power against ALLAH, if HE desired to 
      destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, and his mother and all those that are in 
      the earth ?' And to ALLAH belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth 
      and what is between them. HE creates what HE pleases and ALLAH has power 
      over all things.
