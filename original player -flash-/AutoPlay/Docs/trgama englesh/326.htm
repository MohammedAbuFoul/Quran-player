    <TD>45. Say, `I warn you only according to Divine revelation.' But the 
      deaf cannot hear the call when they are warned. <BR>46. And even if a 
      breath of Thy Lord's punishment touch them, they will surely cry out, `Woe 
      to us ! we were indeed wrongdoers.' <BR>47. And WE shall set up just 
      balances on the Day of Resurrection, so that no soul will be wronged in 
      the least. And even if it be the weight of a grain of mustard seed, WE 
      would bring it forth. And sufficient are WE as reckoners. <BR>48. And WE 
      gave Moses and Aaron the Discrimination and a Light and a Reminder for the 
      righteous, <BR>49. Those who fear their Lord in secret, and who dread the 
      Hour of judgment. <BR>50. And this Qur'an which WE have sent down is a 
      blessed Reminder; will you then reject it ? <BR>51. And before this WE 
      gave Abraham his guidance and WE knew him well. <BR>52. When he said to 
      his father and his people, `What are these images to which you are so 
      devoted ?' <BR>53. They replied, `We found our fathers worshiping them.' 
      <BR>54. He said, `Then, you, as well as your fathers, have indeed been in 
      manifest error.' <BR>55. They said, `Is it really the truth that thou hast 
      brought us, or art thou jesting ?' <BR>56. He replied, `Nay, your Lord is 
      the Lord of the heavens and the earth Who created them; and I am of those 
      who bear witness to this; <BR>57. `And, by ALLAH, I will certainly plan 
      against your idols after you have gone away and turned your 
    backs.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
