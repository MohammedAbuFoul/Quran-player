    <TD>24. And forbidden to you are married women, except such as your right 
      hands possess. This has ALLAH enjoined on you. And allowed to you are 
      those beyond that, that you may seek them by means of your property, 
      marrying them properly and not committing fornication. And for the benefit 
      you receive from them, give them their dowries, as fixed, and there is no 
      blame on you what you do by mutual agreement after the fixing of the 
      dowry. Surely ALLAH is All-Knowing, Wise. <BR>25. And whoso of you cannot 
      afford to marry free believing women, let him marry what your right hands 
      possess, namely your believing hand-maids. And ALLAH knows your faith 
      best; you are all one from another; so marry them with the leave of their 
      masters and give them their dowries, according to what is fair, they being 
      chaste, not committing fornication, nor taking secret paramours. And if, 
      after they are married, they are guilty of lewdness, they shall have half 
      the punishment prescribe for free married women. This is for him among you 
      who fears lest he should commit sin. And that you restrain yourselves is 
      better for you; and ALLAH is Most Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>26. ALLAH 
      desires to make clear to you, and guide you to, the path of those before 
      you and to turn to you in mercy. And ALLAH is All-Knowing, Wise.
