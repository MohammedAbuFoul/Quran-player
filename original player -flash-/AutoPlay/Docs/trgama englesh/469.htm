          <TD>17. This day will every soul be requited for that which it has 
            earned. No injustice this day ! Surely, ALLAH is Swift at reckoning. 
            <BR>18. And warn them of the day that is fast approaching, when the 
            hearts will reach up to the throats, full of suppressed grief. The 
            wrongdoers will have no warm friend, nor any intercessor whose 
            intercession would be accepted. <BR>19. HE knows the treachery of 
            the eyes and what the breasts conceal. <BR>20. And ALLAH judges with 
            truth, but those upon whom they call beside HIM cannot judge at all. 
            Surely, ALLAH is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. <BR>21. Have they 
            not traveled in the earth that they could see what was the end of 
            those before them ? They were mightier than these in power and they 
            left firmer marks in the earth. But ALLAH seized them for their 
            sins, and they had no one to protect them from ALLAH. <BR>22. That 
            was because their Messengers came to them with manifest Signs but 
            they disbelieved; So ALLAH seized them. Surely, HE is Powerful, 
            Severe in punishment. <BR>23. And, surely, WE sent Moses with Our 
            Signs and manifest authority, <BR>24. Unto Pharaoh and Haman and 
            Korah; but they said, `He is a sorcerer and a great liar.' <BR>25. 
            And when he came to them with truth from US, they said, `Slay the 
            sons of those who have believed with him, and let their women live.' 
            But the design of the disbelievers is ever bound to 
        fail.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
