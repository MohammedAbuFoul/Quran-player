    <TD>89. God said, `Your prayer is accepted. So be ye twain steadfast, and 
      follow not the path of those who know not.' <BR>90. And WE brought the 
      children of Israel across the sea; and Pharaoh and his hosts pursued them 
      wrongfully and aggressively, till when the calamity of drowning overtook 
      him, he cried, `I believe that there is no god but HE in Whom the Children 
      of Israel believe, and I am of those who submit to Him.' <BR>91. What ! 
      Now ! while thou wast disobedient before this and wast of the 
      mischief-makers. <BR>92. So this day WE will save thee in thy body alone 
      that thou mayest be a Sign to those who come after thee. And surely many 
      of mankind are heedless of Our Signs. <BR>93. And when WE assigned to the 
      Children of Israel and excellent abode and WE provided them with good 
      things, and they differed not until there came to them the knowledge. 
      Surely, thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection 
      concerning that which they now differ. <BR>94. And if thou art in doubt 
      concerning that which WE have sent down to thee, ask those who have been 
      reading the Book before thee. Indeed the truth has come to thee from thy 
      Lord; be not, therefore, of those who doubt. <BR>95. And be not of those 
      who reject the Signs of ALLAH, or thou shalt be of the losers. <BR>96. 
      Surely, those against whom the decree of punishment of thy Lord has taken 
      effect will not believe. <BR>97. Even if there come to them every Sign 
      till they see the grievous 
punishment.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
