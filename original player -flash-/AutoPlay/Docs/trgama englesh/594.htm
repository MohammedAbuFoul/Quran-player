    <TD>24. He will say, `O, would that I had sent on some good works for my 
      life here !' <BR>25. So on that day none can punish like unto HIS 
      punishment. <BR>26. And none can bind like unto HIS binding. <BR>27. O, 
      thou soul at peace ! <BR>28. Return to thy Lord, thou well-pleased with 
      HIM and HE well-pleased with thee. <BR>29. So enter thou among MY chosen 
      servants, <BR>30. And enter thou MY Garden. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. Nay, I cite as witness this City - <BR>2. And affirm that thou wilt, 
      surely, alight in this City <BR>3. And I cite as witness the father and 
      the son, <BR>4. WE have, surely, created man to toil and struggle. <BR>5. 
      Does he think that no one has power over him ? <BR>6. He says, `I have 
      wasted enormous wealth.' <BR>7. Does he think that no one sees him ? 
      <BR>8. Have WE not given him two eyes, <BR>9. And a tongue and two lips ? 
      <BR>10. And WE have pointed out to him the two highways of good and evil. 
      <BR>11. But he attempted not the steep ascent; <BR>12. And what should 
      make thee know what the steep ascent is ? <BR>13. It is the freeing of a 
      slave, <BR>14. Or, feeding on a day of hunger <BR>15. An orphan near of 
      kin, <BR>16. Or, a poor man lying in the dust. <BR>17. Then he should have 
      been of those who believe and exhort one another to perseverance and 
      exhort one another to mercy. <BR>18. These are the people of the right 
      hand. <BR>19. But those who reject Our Signs, they are the people of the 
      left hand. <BR>20. On them will be Fire closed 
over.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
