    <TD>11. Their Messengers said to them, `We are indeed only mortals like 
      you but ALLAH bestows HIS favours on whomsoever HE wills from among HIS 
      servants. And it is not for us to bring you a proof except by the 
      permission of ALLAH. And in ALLAH alone should the believers put their 
      trust; <BR>12. `And why should we not put our trust in ALLAH when HE has 
      showed us our appropriate ways ? And we will, surely, bear with patience 
      all the harm you do to us. So, in ALLAH let those who trust put their 
      trust. ' <BR>13. And those who disbelieved said to their Messengers, `We 
      will surely, expel you from our land unless you return to our religion.' 
      Then their Lord sent unto them the revelation: `We will surely destroy the 
      wrongdoers, <BR>14. `And WE shall, surely, make you dwell in the land 
      after them. This promise is for him who fears to stand before MY Tribunal 
      and fears MY warning.' <BR>15. And they prayed for victory, and every 
      haughty enemy of truth came to naught: <BR>16. Before him is Hell; and he 
      shall be made to drink boiling water. <BR>17. He shall sip it in and shall 
      not be able to swallow it easily. And death shall come to him from every 
      quarter, yet he shall not die. And besides that there shall be for him a 
      severe chastisement. <BR>18. The case of those who disbelieve in their 
      Lord is that their works are like ashes, on which wind blows violently on 
      a stormy day. They shall have no power over what they earn. That, indeed, 
      is utter ruin.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
