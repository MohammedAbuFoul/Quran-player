    <TD>133. And hasten towards forgiveness from your Lord, and the Paradise 
      whose value is the heavens and the earth. It is prepared for the 
      God-fearing. <BR>134. Those, who spends in prosperity and adversity, and 
      those who suppress anger, and pardon men; and ALLAH loves those who do 
      good; <BR>135. And those who, when they commit a foul deed or wrong 
      themselves, remember ALLAH and implore forgiveness for their sins - and 
      who can forgive sins except ALLAH - and do not knowingly persist in what 
      they do. <BR>136. It is these whose reward is forgiveness from their Lord, 
      and gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide; and an 
      excellent is the reward of good workers. <BR>137. Surely there have been 
      many dispensations before you; so travel through the earth and see how 
      evil was the end of those who treated the Prophets as liars. <BR>138. This 
      Qur'an is a clear demonstration to men, and a guidance and an admonition 
      to the God-fearing. <BR>139. Slacken not nor grieve; and you shall 
      certainly have the upper hand, if you are true believers. <BR>140. If you 
      have received an injury, surely the disbelieving people have already 
      received a similar injury. And such days WE cause to alternate among men 
      that they may be admonished, and that ALLAH may cause to be distinguished 
      those who believe and may take witnesses from among you; and ALLAH loves 
      not the unjust.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
