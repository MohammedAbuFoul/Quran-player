    <TD>34. And HE gives you all that you ask of HIM, and if you try to count 
      the favours of ALLAH, you will not be able to number them. Verily man is 
      very unjust, very ungrateful. <BR>35. And call to mind when Abraham said, 
      `My Lord, make this a city of peace, and preserve me and my children from 
      worshiping idols, <BR>36. `My Lord, they have indeed led astray many among 
      mankind. So whoever follows me, he is certainly of me; and whoever 
      disobeys me Thou art, surely, Most Forgiving, Merciful, <BR>37. `Our Lord, 
      I have settled some of my progeny in an uncultivable valley near Thy 
      Sacred House. - Our Lord, - that they may observe Prayer. So make men's 
      heart incline towards them and provide them with fruits that they may be 
      thankful. <BR>38. `Our Lord, certainly, Thou knowest what we keep secret 
      and what we make known. And nothing whatever is hidden from ALLAH, whether 
      in the earth or the heaven, <BR>39. `All praise belongs to ALLAH Who has 
      given me, despite my old age, Ishmael and Isaac. Surely, my Lord is the 
      Hearer of Prayer, <BR>40. `My Lord make me constant in observing Prayer, 
      and my children too. Our Lord ! bestow thy grace on me and accept my 
      prayer, <BR>41. `Our Lord, forgive me and my parents and the believers on 
      the day when the reckoning will take place.' <BR>42. And think not that 
      ALLAH is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. HE only gives them respite 
      till the day on which their eyes will fixedly stare in 
  horror;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
