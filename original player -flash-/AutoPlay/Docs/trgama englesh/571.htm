    <TD>11. `HE will send down rain for you in abundance, <BR>12. `And HE will 
      grant you increase of wealth and children, and will cause gardens to grow 
      for you and will cause rivers to flow for you. <BR>13. `What is the matter 
      with you that you hope not for greatness and wisdom from ALLAH ? <BR>14. 
      `And HE has created you in different forms and different conditions. 
      <BR>15. `See you not how ALLAH has created seven heavens in perfect 
      harmony, <BR>16. `And has placed the moon, therein a light, and made the 
      sun a lamp ? <BR>17. `And ALLAH has caused you to grow out of the earth as 
      a good growth. <BR>18. `Then HE will cause you to return thereto, and HE 
      will bring you forth a new bringing forth. <BR>19. `And ALLAH has made the 
      earth for you a wide expanse, <BR>20. `That you may traverse the spacious 
      ways thereof.' <BR>21. Then Noah said, `My Lord, they have disobeyed me, 
      and followed one whose wealth and children have only added to his loss. 
      <BR>22. `And they planned a mighty plan.' <BR>23. `And they say to one 
      another `Forsake not your gods, and forsake neither Wadd nor Suwa, nor 
      Yaghuth and Ya`uq and Nasr.' <BR>24. `And they have led many astray; so 
      increase Thou not the wrongdoers in aught but error.' <BR>25. Because of 
      their sins they were drowned and made to enter Fire. And they found no 
      helpers for themselves against ALLAH. <BR>26. And Noah said, `My Lord, 
      leave not of the disbelievers even one dweller in the land; <BR>27. `For, 
      if thou dost leave them, they will only lead astray Thy servants and will 
      beget none but sinners and disbelievers, <BR>28. `My Lord ! forgive me and 
      my parents, and him who enters my house as a believer, and the believing 
      men and the believing women; and increase Thou not the wrongdoers in aught 
      but in ruin.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
