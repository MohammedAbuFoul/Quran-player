    <TD>72. She said, `Oh, woe is me ! Shall I bear a child when I am an 
      extremely old women and this my husband also is a very old man ? This is 
      indeed a strange thing !' <BR>73. They said, `Dost thou marvel at ALLAH's 
      decree ? The mercy of ALLAH and HIS blessings are upon you, O people of 
      the house. Surely, HE is Praiseworthy, Glorious.' <BR>74. And when fear 
      departed from Abraham and the glad tidings came to him, he began to plead 
      with US for the people of Lot. <BR>75. Indeed, Abraham was clement, 
      tender-hearted, and oft-returning to US. <BR>76. `O Abraham, desist from 
      this. Surely, the decree of thy Lord has gone forth, and surely, there is 
      coming to them a punishment that cannot be averted. <BR>77. And when Our 
      Messengers came to Lot, he was grieved on their account and felt helpless 
      for them and he said, `This is a distressful day.' <BR>78. And his people 
      came to him, running towards him, trembling with rage, and before this too 
      they used to do evils. He said, `O my people, these are my daughters; they 
      are purer for you. So fear ALLAH and do not disgrace me in the presence of 
      my guest. Is there not among you one right-minded man ? <BR>79. They 
      answered, `Thou surely knowest that we have no claim against thy 
      daughters, and thou surely knowest what we desire. <BR>80. He said, `Would 
      that I had power to deal with you, or that I could betake myself to a 
      mighty support for shelter. <BR>81. The messengers said, `O Lot, we are 
      the messengers of thy Lord. They shall by no means reach thee so depart 
      with thy family while yet a part of the night remain and let none of you 
      look back, but thy wife. Surely, what is going to befall them shall befall 
      her also. Verily, there appointed time is the morning. It not morning nigh 
      ?'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
