    <TD>82. So when Our decree came to pass, WE turned that town upside down 
      and WE rain upon it stones of clay, layer upon layer, <BR>83. Marked for 
      them in the decree of thy Lord. And such punishment is not far from the 
      wrongdoers of the present age. <BR>84. And to Midian WE sent their brother 
      Shu'aib. He said, `O my people, worship ALLAH. You have no god other than 
      HIM. And give not short measure and short weight. I see you in a state of 
      prosperity and I fear for you the punishment of a destructive day; <BR>85. 
      And O my people, give full measure and full weight with equity and defraud 
      not people of their things and commit not iniquity in the land, causing 
      disorder; <BR>86. That which is left with you by ALLAH is better for you, 
      if you are believers. And I am not appointed a keeper over you.' <BR>87. 
      They replied, `O Shu'aib, does thy Prayer bid thee that we should leave 
      what our fathers worshiped, or that we cease to do with our property what 
      we please ? Surely, thou dost consider thyself very intelligent and 
      right-minded.' <BR>88. He said, `O my people, tell me if I stand on a 
      clear evidence from my Lord, and HE has provided for me from HIMSELF with 
      a handsome provision, what answer will you give HIM ? And I do not desire 
      to do against you the very thing which I ask you not to do. I only desire 
      to set things right as far as I can. I have no power to accomplish 
      anything save through ALLAH. In HIM do I put my trust and to HIM do I 
      turn.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
