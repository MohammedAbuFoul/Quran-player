    <TD>7. And call to mind when WE took from the Prophets their covenant, and 
      from thee, and from Noah and Abraham, and Moses and Jesus, son of Mary, 
      and WE indeed, took from them a solemn covenant; <BR>8. That ALLAH may 
      question the truthful about their truthfulness. And for the disbelievers 
      HE has prepared a painful punishment. <BR>9. O ye who believe, remember 
      the favour of ALLAH to you when there came against you hosts, and WE sent 
      against them a wind and hosts that you saw not. And ALLAH sees what you 
      do. <BR>10. When they came upon you from above you, and from below you, 
      and when your eyes became distracted, and your hearts reached up to your 
      throats, and you thought diverse thoughts about ALLAH. <BR>11. Then were 
      the believers sorely tried, and they were shaken with a violent shaking. 
      <BR>12. And call to mind when the Hypocrites and those in whose hearts was 
      a disease said, `ALLAH and HIS Messenger promised us only delusion;' 
      <BR>13. And when a party of them said, `O people of Yathrib, you can 
      possibly make no stand against the enemy, therefore turn back. And a 
      section of them even asked leave of the Prophet, say, `Our houses are 
      exposed,' whereas they were not exposed. They only sought to flee. <BR>14. 
      If the enemy were to enter the Town from its environs, and then they were 
      asked to join in the disturbance against the Muslims, they would certainly 
      have done so, and would not have tarried in their houses save a little. 
      <BR>15. And truly they had already covenanted with ALLAH that they would 
      not turn their backs. And a covenant with ALLAH will have to be answered 
      for.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
