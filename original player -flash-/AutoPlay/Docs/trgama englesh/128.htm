    <TD>1. All praise belongs to ALLAH Who created the heavens and the earth 
      and brought into being darkness and light; yet those who disbelieve set up 
      equals to their Lord. <BR>2. HE it is Who created you from clay and then 
      HE decreed a term. And there is another term fixed with HIM. Yet you 
      doubt. <BR>3. And HE is ALLAH, the God, both in the heavens and in the 
      earth. HE knows what you disclose and your secrets. And HE knows what you 
      earn. <BR>4. And there comes not to them any Sign of the Signs of their 
      Lord, but they turn away from it. <BR>5. So they rejected the truth when 
      it came to them; but soon shall come to them the tidings of that at which 
      they mocked. <BR>6. See they not how many a generation WE have destroyed 
      before them ? WE had established them in the earth as WE have not 
      established you and WE sent the clouds over them, pouring down abundant 
      rain; and WE caused streams to flow beneath them; then did WE destroy them 
      because of their sins and raised up after them another generation. <BR>7. 
      And if WE had sent down to thee a writing upon the parchment and they had 
      felt it with their hands even then the disbelievers would have surely 
      said, `This is nothing but manifest sorcery.' <BR>8. And they say, `Why 
      has not an angel been sent down to him ?' And if WE had sent down an 
      angel, the matter would have been decided, and then they would have been 
      granted no respite.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
