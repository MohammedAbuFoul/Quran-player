    <TD>55. So as to deny that which WE have bestowed upon them. Well, then, 
      enjoy yourselves a while, but soon will you know. <BR>56. And they set 
      apart for their false gods of which they know nothing, a portion of that 
      which WE have bestowed on them. By ALLAH, you shall certainly be called to 
      account for all that you forged. <BR>57. And they ascribe daughters to 
      ALLAH - Holy is HE - while they themselves have what they desire. <BR>58. 
      And when to one of them is conveyed the tidings of the birth of a female, 
      his face darkens with inward suppressed grief; <BR>59. He hides himself 
      from the people because of the bad news he has had. Shall he keep it 
      inspite of disgrace or shall he bury it in the dust ? Verily, evil is that 
      which they judge. <BR>60. The state of those who do not believe in the 
      Hereafter, is evil, while all sublime attributes belong to ALLAH and HE is 
      the Mighty, the Wise. <BR>61. And if ALLAH were to punish men for their 
      wrongdoing, HE would not leave on the earth a living creature, but HE 
      gives them respite till an appointed term; and when their term is come, 
      they cannot remain behind a single hour, nor can they go ahead of it. 
      <BR>62. And they assign to ALLAH what they dislike for themselves and 
      their tongues utter the lie that they will have the best of everything. 
      Undoubtedly, theirs shall be the Fire, and therein shall they be 
      abandoned. <BR>63. By ALLAH, WE certainly sent Messengers to all the 
      peoples before thee; but Satan made their works appear beautiful to them. 
      So he is their patron this day, and they shall have a grievous punishment. 
      <BR>64. And WE have not sent down to thee the Book except that thou mayest 
      explain to them that concerning which they have created differences and as 
      a guidance, and a mercy for a people who 
believe.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
