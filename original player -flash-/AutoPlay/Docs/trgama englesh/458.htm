    <TD>84. God said, `The truth is, and the truth alone I speak, <BR>85. 
      `That I will, certainly, fill Hell with thee and with those who follow 
      thee, all together.' <BR>86. Say, `I ask not of you any reward for it, nor 
      am I of those who are given to affection. <BR>87. `The Qur'an is nothing 
      but a Reminder for all peoples. <BR>88. `And you shall, surely, know the 
      truth of it after a while,' <BR>&nbsp;
      <HR width="90%" color=#000000 SIZE=3>
      1. The revelation of this Book is from ALLAH, the Mighty, the Wise. <BR>2. 
      Surely, it is WE Who have revealed the Book to thee comprising the whole 
      truth, so worship ALLAH, being sincere to HIM in obedience. <BR>3. 
      Remember, it is to ALLAH alone that sincere obedience is due. And those 
      who take as protectors others beside HIM, say, `We serve them only that 
      they may bring us near to ALLAH in station.' Surely, ALLAH will judge 
      between them concerning that wherein they differ. Surely, ALLAH guides not 
      him who is an ungrateful liar. <BR>4. If ALLAH had desired to take to 
      Himself a son, HE could have chosen whom HE pleased out of what HE 
      creates. Holy is HE ! HE is ALLAH, the One, the Most Supreme. <BR>5. HE 
      created the heavens and the earth in accordance with the requirements of 
      wisdom. HE makes the night to cover the day, and HE makes the day to cover 
      the night; and he has pressed the sun and the moon into service; each 
      pursues its course until an appointed time. Remember, it is HE alone Who 
      is the Mighty, the Great 
Forgiver.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
