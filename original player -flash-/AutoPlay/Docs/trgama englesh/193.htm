    <TD>37. Surely the postponement of the Sacred Month is an addition to 
      disbelief. Those who disbelieve are led astray thereby. They allow it one 
      year and forbid it another year, that they may agree in the number of the 
      months which ALLAH has made sacred, and thus make lawful what ALLAH has 
      forbidden. The evil of their deeds is made to seem fair to them. And ALLAH 
      guides not the disbelieving people. <BR>38. O ye who believe; what is the 
      matter with you that, when it is said to you, go forth in the way of 
      ALLAH, you sink down heavily towards the earth ? Are you contented with 
      the present life in the preference to the Hereafter ? But the enjoyment of 
      the present life is but little compared to the Hereafter. <BR>39. If you 
      will not go forth to fight in the cause of ALLAH, HE will punish you with 
      a painful punishment, and will chose in your stead a people other than 
      you, and you shall do HIM no harm at all. And ALLAH has full power over 
      all things. <BR>40. If you help him not, then know that ALLAH helped him 
      even when the disbelievers drove him forth while he was one of the two, 
      when they were both in the Cave, when he said to his Companion, `Grieve 
      not for ALLAH is with us.' Then ALLAH sent down HIS peace on him, and 
      succoured him with hosts which you did not see, and humbled the word of 
      those who disbelieved, and it is the word of ALLAH alone which is supreme. 
      And ALLAH is Mighty, Wise.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
