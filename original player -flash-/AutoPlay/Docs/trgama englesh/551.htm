    <TD>12. O Prophet ! when believing women come to thee, taking the oath of 
      allegiance at thy hands that they will not associate anything with ALLAH, 
      and that they will not steal, and will not commit adultery, nor kill their 
      children, nor bring forth a scandalous charge which they themselves have 
      deliberately forged, nor disobey thee in what is right, then accept their 
      allegiance and ask ALLAH to forgive them. Verily, ALLAH is Most Forgiving, 
      Merciful. <BR>13. O ye who believe ! take not for friends a people with 
      whom ALLAH is wroth; they have, indeed, despaired of the Hereafter just as 
      have the disbelievers despaired of those who are in the graves. <BR>&nbsp;
      <HR width="90%" color=#000000 SIZE=3>
      1. Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth glorifies 
      ALLAH; and HE is the Mighty, the Wise. <BR>2. O ye who believe ! Why do 
      you say what you do not ? <BR>3. It is most hateful in the sight of ALLAH 
      that you say what you do not. <BR>4. Verily, ALLAH loves those who fight 
      in HIS cause arrayed in solid ranks, as though they were a strong 
      structure cemented with molten lead. <BR>5. And call to mind when Moses 
      said to his people, `O my people, why do you malign me and you know that I 
      am ALLAH's Messenger unto you ?' So when they deviated from the right 
      course, ALLAH caused their hearts to deviate; for ALLAH guides not the 
      rebellious people.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
