    <TD>1. Surely, WE sent it down during the Night of Decree. <BR>2. And what 
      shall make thee know what the Night of Decree is ? <BR>3. The Night of 
      Decree is better than a thousand months. <BR>4. Therein descend angels and 
      the Spirit by the command of their Lord with Divine decree concerning 
      every matter. <BR>5. It is all peace till the rising of the dawn.

      1. Those, who disbelieve from among the People of the Book and the 
      idolaters, would not desist from disbelief until there should come to them 
      the clear evidence - <BR>2. A Messenger from ALLAH, reciting unto them the 
      pure Scriptures, <BR>3. Wherein are lasting commandments. <BR>4. And those 
      to whom the Book was given did not become divided until after clear 
      evidence had come to them. <BR>5. And they were not commanded but to serve 
      ALLAH, being sincere to HIM in obedience, and being upright, and to 
      observe Prayer and pay the Zakat. And that is the right religion. <BR>6. 
      Verily, those who disbelieve from among the People of the Book and the 
      idolaters, will be in the Fire of Hell, abiding therein. They are the 
      worst of creatures. <BR>7. Verily, those who believe and do righteous 
      deeds they are the best of 
creatures.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
