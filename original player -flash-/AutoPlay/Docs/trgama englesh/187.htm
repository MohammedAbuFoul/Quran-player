    <TD>1. This is a declaration of complete vindication on the part of ALLAH 
      and HIS Messenger to the idolaters to whom you had announce a commitment 
      that Islam would triumph in Arabia. <BR>2. So go about in the land for 
      four months, and know that you cannot frustrate the plan of ALLAH and that 
      ALLAH will humiliate the disbelievers. <BR>3. And this is a proclamation 
      from ALLAH and HIS Messenger to the people on the day of the Greater 
      Pilgrimage, that ALLAH is clear of idolaters, and so is HIS Messenger. So 
      if you repent, it will be better for you; but if you turn away, then know 
      that you cannot frustrate the plan of ALLAH. And give tidings of a painful 
      punishment to those who disbelieve, <BR>4. Except those of the 
      disbelievers with whom you have entered into a treaty and who have not 
      subsequently failed you in anything nor aided anyone against you. So 
      fulfill to these the treaty you have made with them till their term. 
      Surely ALLAH loves those that are righteous. <BR>5. And when the forbidden 
      months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever you find them and take 
      them captive, and beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them at every place 
      of ambush. But if they repent and observe Prayer and pay the Zakat, then 
      leave their way free. Surely, ALLAH is Most Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>6. 
      And if anyone of the idolaters seeks protection of thee, grant him 
      protection so that he may hear the Word of ALLAH; then convey him to his 
      place of security. That is because they are a people who have no 
      knowledge.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
