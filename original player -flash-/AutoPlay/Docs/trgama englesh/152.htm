    <TD>12. God said, `What prevented thee from submitting when I commanded 
      thee ?' He said, `I am better than he. Thou hast created me of fire while 
      him hast thou created of clay.' <BR>13. God said, `Then go down hence; it 
      is not for thee to be arrogant here. Get out; thou art certainly of those 
      who are abased.' <BR>14. He said, `Respite me till the day when they will 
      be raised up.' <BR>15. God said, `Thou art of those who are respited.' 
      <BR>16. He said, `Now, since Thou hast adjudge me to be erring, I will 
      assuredly lie in wait for them on Thy straight path; <BR>17. `Then will I 
      surely come upon them from before them and from behind them and from their 
      right and from their left, and Thou wilt not find most of them to be 
      grateful. <BR>18. God said, `Get out hence, despised and banished. 
      Whosoever of them shall follow thee, I will surely fill Hell with you 
      all;' <BR>19. `O Adam ! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden and eat 
      therefrom wherever you will, but approach not this tree lest you be among 
      the wrongdoers. <BR>20. But satan made evil suggestions to them so that he 
      might make known to them what was hidden from them of their shame and 
      said, `Your Lord has only forbidden you this tree, lest you become angels 
      or lest you become of the immortals.' <BR>21. And he swore to them, 
      saying, `Surely I am a sincere counsellor unto you.' <BR>22. So he caused 
      them to fall into disobedience by deceit. And when they tasted of the 
      tree, their shame became manifest to them and they both began to cover 
      themselves with the leaves of the Gardens. And their Lord called them, 
      saying, `Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you, verily Satan is to 
      you an open enemy ?'&nbsp;</TD></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
