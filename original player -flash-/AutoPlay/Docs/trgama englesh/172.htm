    <TD>164. And when a party among them said to another party, `Why do you 
      admonish a people whom ALLAH is going to destroy or punish with a severe 
      punishment ?' They said, `In order to be absolved from blame before your 
      Lord and that they may turn to righteousness.' <BR>165. And when they 
      forgot all that with which they had been admonished, WE saved those who 
      forbade evil and WE seized the transgressors with a severe punishment 
      because they were rebellious. <BR>166. And when they insolently rebelled 
      against that which they had been forbidden, WE said to them, `Be ye apes 
      despised.' <BR>167. And remember the time when thy Lord proclaimed that HE 
      would surely rise against them, till the Day of Resurrection, those who 
      would afflict them with grievous torment. Surely, thy Lord is Quick in 
      retribution and surely HE is also Most forgiving, Merciful. <BR>168. And 
      WE broke them up into separate peoples in the earth. Among them are those 
      that are righteous and among them are those that are otherwise. And WE 
      tried them with good things and bad things that they might return to good. 
      <BR>169. Then there came after them an evil generation who inherited the 
      Book. They take the paltry goods of this low world and say, `It will be 
      forgiven us.' But if there came to them similar goods again, they would 
      take them. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them, that they 
      would not say of ALLAH anything but the truth ? And they have studied what 
      is therein. And the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are 
      righteous. Will you not then understand. <BR>170. And as for those who 
      hold fast by the Book and observe Prayer, surely, WE suffer not the reward 
      of the righteous to perish.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
