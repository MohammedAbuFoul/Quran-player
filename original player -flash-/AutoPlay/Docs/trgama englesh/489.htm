    <TD>52. And thus have We revealed to thee the Word by Our command. Thou 
      didst not know what the Book was, nor what the faith. But We have made the 
      revelation a light, whereby We guide such of Our servants as WE please. 
      And, truly, thou guidest mankind to the right path, <BR>53. The path of 
      ALLAH, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the 
      earth. Remember, to ALLAH do all things return. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. Ha Mim. <BR>2. WE cite as evidence this perspicuous Book, <BR>3. WE 
      have made it a Book to be oft read in clear, eloquent language that you 
      may understand. <BR>4. And, surely, it is safe with US in the Mother of 
      the Book, exalted and full of wisdom. <BR>5. Shall WE then take away the 
      reminder from you, leaving you without guidance because you are an 
      extravagant people ? <BR>6. And how many a Prophet did WE send among the 
      earlier peoples ! <BR>7. But there never came to them a Prophet but they 
      mocked at him. <BR>8. And WE destroyed those who were mightier in power 
      than these, and the example of the earlier peoples has gone before. <BR>9. 
      And if thou ask them, `Who created the heavens and the earth ?' they will, 
      surely, say `The Mighty, the All-Knowing God created them,' <BR>10. HE, 
      Who has made the earth for you a cradle and has made pathways for you 
      therein, that you may follow the right 
way;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
