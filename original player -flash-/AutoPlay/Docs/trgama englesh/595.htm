    <TD>1. By the sun and its brightness, <BR>2. And by the moon when it 
      follows the sun, <BR>3. And by the day when it reveals the sun's glory, 
      <BR>4. And by the night when it draws a veil over the light of the sun. 
      <BR>5. And by the heaven and its wonderful structure. <BR>6. And by the 
      earth and its expanse, <BR>7. And by the soul and its perfection - <BR>8. 
      And HE revealed to it the ways of evil and the ways of righteousness - 
      <BR>9. He, indeed, prospers who purifies it, <BR>10. And he is ruined who 
      corrupts it. <BR>11. The tribe of Thamud rejected the Divine Messenger 
      because of their rebelliousness, <BR>12. When the most wretched among them 
      got up. <BR>13. Then the Messenger of ALLAH said, `Leave alone the 
      she-camel of ALLAH and obstruct not her drink.' <BR>14. But they called 
      him a liar and hamstrung her, so their Lord destroyed them completely 
      because of their sin, and made destruction overtake all of them alike. 
      <BR>15. And HE cared not for the consequences thereof. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. By the night when it covers up; <BR>2. And by the day when it shines 
      forth, <BR>3. And by the creation of the male and the female, <BR>4. 
      Surely, your strivings are diverse. <BR>5. Then as for him who gives for 
      the cause of ALLAH and is righteous, <BR>6. And testifies to the truth of 
      what is right, <BR>7. WE will provide for him every facility for good. 
      <BR>8. But as for him who is niggardly and is disdainfully indifferent, 
      <BR>9. And rejects what is right, <BR>10. WE will make easy for him the 
      path to distress. <BR>11. And his wealth shall not avail him when he 
      perishes. <BR>12. Surely, it is for US to guide; <BR>13. And to US belongs 
      the Hereafter as well as the present world. <BR>14. So I warn you of a 
      blazing Fire.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
