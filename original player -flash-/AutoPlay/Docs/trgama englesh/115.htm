    <TD>42. They are eager listeners to falsehood, devourers of things 
      forbidden. If, then, they come to thee for judgment, judge between them or 
      turn aside from them. And if thou turn aside from them, they cannot harm 
      thee at all. And if thou judge, judge between them with justice. Surely 
      ALLAH loves those who are just. <BR>43. And how will they make thee their 
      judge when they have with them the Torah, wherein is ALLAH's judgment ? 
      Yet in spite of that they turn their backs; and certainly they will not 
      believe. <BR>44. Surely, WE sent down the Torah wherein was guidance and 
      light. By it did the Prophets, who were obedient to US, judge for the 
      Jews, as did the godly people and those learned in the Law, because they 
      were required to preserve the Book of ALLAH, and because they were 
      guardians over it. Therefore fear not men but fear ME; and barter not MY 
      signs for a paltry price. And whoso judges not by that which ALLAH has 
      sent down, these it is who are the disbelievers. <BR>45. And therein WE 
      prescribed for them: Life for life, and eye for eye, nose for nose, ear 
      for ear, and tooth for tooth, and for other injuries equitable 
      retaliation. And whoso waives the right thereto, it shall be an expiation 
      for his own sins; and whoso judges not by what ALLAH has sent down, these 
      it is who are wrongdoers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
