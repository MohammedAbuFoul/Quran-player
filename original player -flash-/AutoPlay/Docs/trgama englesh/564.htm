    <TD>27. But when they see it nigh, the faces of those who disbelieve will 
      be grief-stricken, and it will be said, `This is what you repeatedly asked 
      for.' <BR>28. Say, `Tell me, if ALLAH should destroy me and those who are 
      with me, or have mercy upon us, who will protect the disbelievers from a 
      painful torment ?' <BR>29. Say, `HE is the Beneficent God, in HIM have we 
      believed and in HIM have we put our trust. And you will soon know who is 
      in manifest error.' <BR>30. Say, `Tell me, if all your water were to 
      disappear in the depths of the earth, who then, will bring you pure 
      running water ?' <BR>&nbsp;

      1. By the inkstand and the pen and by that which they write; <BR>2. Thou 
      art not, by the grace of thy Lord, a madman. <BR>3. And for thee, most 
      surely, there is an unending reward. <BR>4. And thou dost, surely, possess 
      sublime moral excellences. <BR>5. And thou wilt soon see and they, too, 
      will see. <BR>6. Which of you is afflicted with madness. <BR>7. Surely, 
      thy Lord knows best those who go astray from HIS way, and HE knows best 
      those who follow guidance. <BR>8. So comply not with the wishes of those 
      who reject the Truth. <BR>9. They wish that thou shouldst compromise so 
      that they may also compromise. <BR>10. Yield thou not to any mean swearer, 
      <BR>11. Backbiter, one who goes about slandering. <BR>12. Forbidder of 
      good, transgressor, sinful, <BR>13. Ill-mannered and, in addition to that, 
      of doubtful birth, <BR>14. Only because he possesses riches and children, 
      <BR>15. When our Signs are recited unto him, he say, `Tales of the 
      ancients.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
