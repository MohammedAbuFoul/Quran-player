    <TD>53. `Our Lord, we believe in that which thou hast sent down and we 
      follow this Messenger. So write us down among those who bear witness.' 
      <BR>54. And Jesus's enemies planned and ALLAH also planned, and ALLAH is 
      the Best of Planners. <BR>55. Remember the time when ALLAH said' `O Jesus, 
      I will take you and raise you to Myself, and will clear thee of the 
      charges of those who disbelieve, and will exalt those who follow thee 
      above those who disbelieve, until the Day of Resurrection; then to ME 
      shall be your return, and I will judge between you concerning that wherein 
      you differ. <BR>56. `Then as for those who disbelieve, I will punish them 
      with a severe punishment in this world and in the next, and they shall 
      have no helpers; <BR>57. `And as for those who believe and do good works, 
      HE will give them their full rewards. And ALLAH loves not the wrongdoers.' 
      <BR>58. That is what WE recite unto thee of the Signs and the Reminder, 
      full of Wisdom. <BR>59. Surely the case of Jesus is like the case of Adam. 
      HE created him out of dust, then he said to him, "Be', and he was. <BR>60. 
      This is the truth from thy Lord, so be thou not of those who doubt. 
      <BR>61. Now whoso disputes with thee concerning him, after what has come 
      to thee of Knowledge, say to him `Come, let us call our sons and your 
      sons, and our women and your women, and our people and your people; then 
      let us pray fervently and invoke the curse of ALLAH on those who 
    lie.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
