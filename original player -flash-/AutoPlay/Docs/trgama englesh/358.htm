    <TD>59. And when the children among you reach puberty, they too should ask 
      leave, even as their elders before them asked leave. Thus does ALLAH make 
      plain to you HIS commandments; And ALLAH is All-Knowing, Wise. <BR>60. 
      Such elderly women as are past the age of marriage -there is no blame on 
      them if they lay aside their outer clothing without displaying their 
      beauty. But to abstain even from that is better for them. And ALLAH is 
      All-Hearing, All-Knowing. <BR>61. There is no harm for the blind, and 
      there is no harm for the lame, and there is no harm for the sick and none 
      for yourselves, that you eat from your own houses, or the houses of your 
      fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or 
      the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your father's brothers, or 
      the houses of your father's sisters, or the houses of your mother's 
      brothers, or the houses of your mother's sisters, or the houses of which 
      the keys are in your possession, or from the house of a friend of yours. 
      Nor is there any harm whether you eat together or separately. But when you 
      enter houses, salute your people with the greeting of peace - a greeting 
      from your Lord, full of blessing and purity. Thus does ALLAH expound to 
      you the commandments, that you may 
understand.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
