    <TD>21. And thus did WE disclose them to the people that they might know 
      that the promise of ALLAH was true, and that, as to the promised Hour, 
      there was no doubt about it. And call to mind the time when people 
      disputed among themselves concerning them, and said to each other, `Build 
      over them a building.' Their Lord knew them best. `We will, surely, build 
      a place of worship over them.' <BR>22. Some say, `They were three, the 
      fourth of them was their dog;' and others say, `They were five, the sixth 
      of them was their dog,' guessing at random. And yet others say, `They were 
      seven, the eighth of them was their dog.' Say, `My Lord knows best their 
      correct number. None knows them except a few.' So argue not concerning 
      them except with unanswerable arguments, nor seek information concerning 
      them from anyone of them. <BR>23. And say not of anything, `I shall do 
      that tomorrow,' <BR>24. Unless ALLAH should will. And remember thy Lord 
      when thou forgetest and say, `I hope my Lord will guide me to what is even 
      nearer than this to the right path.' <BR>25. And they stayed in their Cave 
      three hundred years and to that they added nine. <BR>26. Say, `ALLAH knows 
      best how long they tarried.' To HIM belong the secrets of the heavens and 
      the earth. How Seeing is HE, and how Hearing ! They have no helper beside 
      HIM, and HE does not let anyone share in HIS judgment. <BR>27. And recite 
      what has been revealed to thee of the Book of thy Lord. There is none who 
      can change HIS words, and thou wilt find no refuge beside 
  HIM.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
