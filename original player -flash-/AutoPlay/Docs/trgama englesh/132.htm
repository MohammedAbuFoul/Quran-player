    <TD>36. Only those can accept the truth who listen. And as for the dead, 
      ALLAH will raise them to life, then to HIM shall they all be brought back. 
      <BR>37. And they say, `Why has not a Sign been sent down to him from his 
      Lord ?' Say, `Surely ALLAH has the power to send down a Sign, but most of 
      them do not know.' <BR>38. There is not an animal that crawls in the 
      earth, nor a bird that flies on its two wings, but they are communities 
      like you. WE have left out nothing in the Book. Then to their Lord shall 
      they all be gathered together. <BR>39. Those who have rejected OUR signs 
      are deaf and dumb, in utter darkness. Whom ALLAH wills HE lets go astray 
      and whom HE wills HE places on the right path. <BR>40. Say,`Will you tell 
      me if the punishment of ALLAH come or there come upon you the Hour, will 
      you call upon any other than ALLAH, if you are truthful ? <BR>41. Nay, but 
      on HIM alone will you call; then will HE remove, if HE pleases, that which 
      you call on HIM to remove, and you will forget what you associate with 
      HIM.' <BR>42. And indeed WE sent Messengers to peoples before thee; then 
      WE afflicted them with poverty and adversity that they might humble 
      themselves. <BR>43. Why, then, when OUR punishment came upon them, did 
      they not humble themselves ? But their hearts were hardened all the more 
      and Satan made all that they did seem fair to them. <BR>44. When they 
      forgot that with which they had been admonished, and WE opened unto them 
      the gates of all things, till, even as they were rejoicing in what they 
      were given, WE seized them suddenly, and lo ! they were in utter 
    despair.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
