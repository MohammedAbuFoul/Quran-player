    <TD>36. And when Moses came to them with Our clear Signs, they said, `This 
      is nothing but a forged sorcery, and we never heard the like of this among 
      our forefathers.' <BR>37. Moses said, `My Lord knows best who it is that 
      has brought guidance from HIM, and whose will be the reward of the final 
      abode. Verily, the wrongdoers never prosper. <BR>38. And Pharaoh said, `O 
      chiefs, I know of no god for you other than myself; so burn me bricks of 
      clay, O Haman, and build me a tower, that I may, by climbing it, have a 
      look at the God of Moses, for I think that he is a liar.' <BR>39. And he 
      and his hosts behaved arrogantly in the land without justification. And 
      they thought that they would never be brought back to US. <BR>40. So WE 
      seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea. See, then, how evil 
      was the end of the wrongdoers ! <BR>41. And WE made them leaders who 
      called people unto the Fire; and on the Day of Resurrection they will not 
      be helped. <BR>42. And WE caused them to be followed by a curse in this 
      world; and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among those deprived of 
      all good. <BR>43. And WE gave Moses the Book, after WE had destroyed the 
      earlier generations, as a source of enlightenment for men, and a guidance 
      and a mercy, that they might 
reflect.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
