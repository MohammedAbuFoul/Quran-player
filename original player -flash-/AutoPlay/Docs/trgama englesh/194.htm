    <TD>41. Go forth, light or heavy, and strive with your wealth and your 
      lives in the cause of ALLAH. That is best for you, if only you knew. 
      <BR>42. If it had been an immediate gain and a short journey, they would 
      certainly have followed thee, but the hard journey seem too long to them. 
      Yet they will swear by ALLAH, saying, `If we had been able, we would 
      surely have gone forth with you.' They but ruin their souls; and ALLAH 
      knows that they are liars. <BR>43. ALLAH remove the ill consequences of 
      thy mistake. Why didst thou permit them to stay behind till it had become 
      clear to thee and thou hadst also known the liars ? <BR>44. Those who 
      believe in ALLAH and the Last Day will not ask leave of thee to be 
      exempted from striving with their wealth and their persons. And ALLAH well 
      knows those who keep their duty to HIM. <BR>45. Only those will ask leave 
      of thee to be exempted who do not believe in ALLAH and the Last Day, and 
      whose hearts are full of doubt, and in their doubt they waver. <BR>46. And 
      if they had readily intended to go forth, they would have made some 
      preparations for it; but ALLAH was averse to their marching forth. so HE 
      kept them back, and it was said to them; `keep sitting at home with those 
      who have kept sitting.' <BR>47. Had they gone forth with you, they would 
      have added to you naught but trouble, and would have hurried to and fro in 
      your midst, seeking to sow discord among you. And there are among you 
      those who would listen to you so as to convey information to them. And 
      ALLAH well knows the 
wrongdoers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
