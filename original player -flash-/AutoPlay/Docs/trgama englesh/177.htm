    <TD>1. They ask thee concerning the spoils. Say, `The spoils of war are 
      for ALLAH and the Messenger. So fear ALLAH, and set things right among 
      yourselves, and obey ALLAH and HIS Messenger, if you are believers.' 
      <BR>2. They are only the true believers whose hearts tremble when the name 
      of ALLAH is mentioned, and when HIS Signs are recited to them they 
      increase their faith, and who put their trust in their Lord. <BR>3. Who 
      observe Prayer and spend out of that which WE have provided for them. 
      <BR>4. These it is who are true believers. They have exalted grades of 
      rank with their Lord, as well as forgiveness and an honourable provision. 
      <BR>5. This is because thy Lord has brought thee forth from thy house for 
      a righteous purpose while a party of the believers were quite averse to 
      it. <BR>6. They (the disbelievers) dispute with thee concerning the truth 
      after it has become manifest, as though they are being driven to death 
      while they actually see it. <BR>7. And remember when ALLAH promised you 
      one of the two parties that it should be yours, and you wished that the 
      one unarmed should be yours, but ALLAH desired to establish the Truth by 
      HIS words and to cut off the root of the disbelievers, <BR>8. That HE 
      might establish the Truth and bring to naught that which is false, 
      although the guilty may dislike 
it.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
