    <TD>15. But WE saved him and those who were with him in the Ark; and WE 
      made it a Sign for all peoples. <BR>16. And WE sent Abraham when he said 
      to his people, `Worship ALLAH and fear HIM. That is better for you, if 
      only you knew; <BR>17. `You only worship idols beside ALLAH, and you 
      invent a lie. Those, whom you worship beside ALLAH, have no power to 
      provide sustenance for you. Then seek sustenance from ALLAH, and worship 
      HIM, and be Grateful to HIM. Unto HIM will you be brought back.' <BR>18. 
      And if you reject the truth, then the generations before you also rejected 
      it. And the Messenger is only responsible for the clear delivery of the 
      Message. <BR>19. See they not how ALLAH originates creation, then repeats 
      it ? That, surely, is easy for ALLAH. <BR>20. Say, `Travel in the earth, 
      and see how HE originated the creation. Then will ALLAH create the second 
      creation. Surely, ALLAH has power over all things; <BR>21. HE punishes 
      whom HE pleases and shows mercy unto whom HE pleases; and to HIM will you 
      be turned back; <BR>22. And you cannot frustrate the designs of ALLAH in 
      the earth nor in the heaven; nor have you any friend or helper beside 
      ALLAH.' <BR>23. Those who disbelieve in the Signs of ALLAH and the meeting 
      with HIM - it is they who despair of MY mercy. And they will have a 
      grievous punishment.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
