    <TD>45. So the last remnant of the people who did wrong was cut off; and 
      all praise belongs to ALLAH, the Lord of all the worlds. <BR>46. Say, 
      `Will you tell me, if ALLAH should take away your hearing and your sight, 
      and seal up your hearts, who is the god other than ALLAH who can bring it 
      back to you ?' See how WE expound the Signs in various ways, yet they turn 
      away. <BR>47. Say, `Will you tell me, if the punishment of ALLAH come upon 
      you suddenly or openly, will any be destroyed save the wrongdoing people 
      ?' <BR>48. And WE sent not the Messengers but as bearers of glad tidings 
      and as Warners. So those who believe and reform themselves, on them shall 
      come no fear nor shall they grieve. <BR>49. And those who reject our 
      Signs, punishment will touch them, because they disobeyed. <BR>50. Say, `I 
      do not say to you: `I possess the treasures of ALLAH, nor do I know the 
      unseen; nor do I say to you: `I am an angel, I follow only that which is 
      revealed to me.' Say, `Can a blind man and one who sees be alike ?' Will 
      you not then reflect. <BR>51. And warn thereby those who fear that they 
      shall be gathered to their Lord that they shall have no friend nor 
      intercessor besides HIM, so that they may become righteous. <BR>52. And 
      drive not away those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking 
      HIS pleasure. Thou art not at all accountable for them nor are they 
      accountable for thee. So if thou shouldst drive them away thou wilt be of 
      the unjust.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
