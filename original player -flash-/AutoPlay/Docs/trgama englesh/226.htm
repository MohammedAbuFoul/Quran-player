    <TD>38. And he started making the Ark; and every time the chiefs of his 
      people passed by him, they mocked at him. He said, `If now you mock at us, 
      the time is coming when we shall mock at you even just as you mock now. 
      <BR>39. Then you shall know who it is on whom will come a punishment that 
      will disgrace him; and on whom will fall a lasting punishment.' <BR>40. 
      Till -- when our command came and the fountains of the earth gushed forth 
      - WE said, `Embark therein two of every kind, male and female, and thy 
      family, except those against whom the word has already gone forth, and 
      those who believe.' And there had not believe in him except a few. <BR>41. 
      And he said, `Embark therein. In the name of ALLAH, be its course and its 
      mooring. My Lord is assuredly Most Forgiving, Merciful.' <BR>42. And it 
      moved along with them amid waves like mountains. And Noah cried unto his 
      son, while he was keeping apart, `O my son, embark with us and be not with 
      the disbelievers.' <BR>43. He replied, `I shall soon betake myself for 
      refuge to a mountain which will shelter me from the water.' Noah said, 
      `There is no shelter for anyone this day from the decree of ALLAH, except 
      for him to whom HE shows mercy.' And the waves came in between the two; so 
      he was among the drowned. <BR>44. And it was said, `O earth, swallow thy 
      water, and O sky, cease raining.' And the water was made to subside and 
      the matter was decided. And the Ark came to rest on Al-Judi. And it was 
      said, `Cursed be the wrongdoing people.' <BR>45. And Noah cried unto his 
      Lord and said, `My Lord, verily, my son is of my family, and surely Thy 
      promise is true, and Thou art the Most Just of 
judges.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
