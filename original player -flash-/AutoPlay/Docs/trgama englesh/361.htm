    <TD>12. When it sees them from a place far-off, they will hear its raging 
      and roaring. <BR>13. And when they are thrown into a narrow place thereof, 
      chained together, they will pray there for destruction. <BR>14. `Pray not 
      this day for one destruction, but pray for many destructions,' <BR>15. 
      Say, `Is that better or the Garden of Eternity, which is promised to the 
      righteous ? It will be their reward and ultimate resort.' <BR>16. They 
      will have therein whatsoever they desire, abiding therein for ever. It is 
      a promise binding upon thy Lord, and to be always prayed for from HIM. 
      <BR>17. On the day when HE will assemble them and those whom they worship 
      instead of ALLAH, HE will ask the latter, `Was it you that led astray 
      these MY servants, or did they themselves stray away from the Path ?' 
      <BR>18. They will say, `Holy art Thou ! It was not right for us to take 
      protectors other than Thee; but Thou didst bestow on them and their 
      fathers the good things of this life until they forgot Thy admonition and 
      became a ruined people.' <BR>19. Then WE shall say to their worshippers, 
      `They have given you the lie regarding what you said, so you cannot avert 
      the punishment, neither can you get help. And whosoever among you does 
      wrong, WE shall make him taste a grievous punishment. <BR>20. And WE did 
      not send any Messengers before thee but surely they ate food and walked in 
      the streets. And WE make some of you a trial for others to see whether you 
      are steadfast. And thy Lord is 
All-Seeing.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
