    <TD>70. And when he had given them their provisions, he put the drinking 
      cup in his brothers saddle-bag. Then a crier cried. 'O ye men of the 
      caravan, you are surely thieves.' <BR>71. They said, turning around 
      towards them, `What is that you miss ?' <BR>72. They replied, `We miss the 
      King's measuring-vessel and whoso brings it shall have a camel-load of 
      corn and I am surety for it.' <BR>73. They answered, `By ALLAH, you know 
      well that we came not to make mischief in the land, and we are not 
      thieves.' <BR>74. They said, `What then shall be the punishment for it, if 
      you are found to be liars ?' <BR>75. They replied, `The punishment for it 
      - he in whose saddle-bag it is found shall himself be the penalty for it. 
      Thus do we punish the wrongdoers.' <BR>76. Then he began with the search 
      of their sacks before the sack of Joseph's brother; then he took it out of 
      the sack of his brother. He could not have taken his brother under the 
      King's law unless ALLAH had so willed. WE raise in degrees of rank 
      whomsoever WE please; and over every possessor of knowledge is One, 
      Most-Knowing. <BR>77. They replied, `If he has stolen, a brother of his 
      had also committed theft before.' But Joseph kept it a secret in his heart 
      and did not disclose it to them. He simply said, `You are in a worst 
      condition; and ALLAH knows best what you allege.' <BR>78. They said, `O 
      noble chief, he has a very aged father, so take one of us in his place; 
      for we see thee to be one of those who are 
benevolent.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
