    <TD>12. If only thou couldst see when the guilty ones will hang down their 
      heads before their Lord, and say, `Our Lord, we have seen and we have 
      heard, so send us back that we may do good works; for now we are convinced 
      of the truth of what we were told.' <BR>13. And if WE had enforced Our 
      will, WE could have given every soul its appropriate guidance, but the 
      word from ME has come true that I will fill Hell with jinn and men all 
      together. <BR>14. So taste ye the punishment of your evil deeds, for you 
      forgot the meeting of this day of yours. We too, have forgotten you. Taste 
      ye then the lasting punishment because of that which you used to do. 
      <BR>15. Only those really believe in Our Signs who, when they are reminded 
      of them, fall down prostrate and celebrate the praises of their Lord, and 
      they are not proud. <BR>16. Their sides keep away from their beds; and 
      they call on their Lord in fear and hope, and spend out of what WE have 
      bestowed on them. <BR>17. And no soul knows what joy of the eyes is kept 
      hidden for them, as a reward for the good they used to do. <BR>18. Is he, 
      then, who is a believer like one who is disobedient ? they are not equal. 
      <BR>19. As for those who believe and do good works, they will have Gardens 
      of Eternal Abode as an entertainment in return for what they used to do. 
      <BR>20. And as for those who are disobedient, their abode will be the 
      Fire. Every time they desire to come out of it, they will be turned back 
      into it, and it will be said to them, `Taste ye the punishment of the Fire 
      which you used to deny.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
