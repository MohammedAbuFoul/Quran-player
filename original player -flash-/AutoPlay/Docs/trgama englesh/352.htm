    <TD>21. O ye who believe ! Follow not the footsteps of Satan, and whoso 
      follows the footsteps of satan should know that he, surely, enjoins 
      indecency and manifest evil. And but for the grace of ALLAH and HIS mercy 
      upon you, not one of you would ever be pure; but ALLAH purifies whom HE 
      pleases. And ALLAH is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. <BR>22. And let not 
      persons of wealth and means among you swear that they will not give aught 
      to the kindred and to the needy and to those who have left their homes in 
      the cause of ALLAH. Let them forgive and forbear. Do you not desire that 
      ALLAH should forgive you ? And ALLAH is Most Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>23. 
      Verily, those, who calumniate chaste, unwary, believing women, are cursed 
      in this world and the hereafter. And for them is a grievous chastisement, 
      <BR>24. On the day when their tongues and their hands and their feet will 
      bear witness against them as to what they used to do; <BR>25. On that day 
      will ALLAH will pay them in full their just due, and they will know that 
      ALLAH alone is the Manifest Truth. <BR>26. Evil things are a 
      characteristic of bad men, and bad men are inclined towards bad things. 
      And good things are a characteristic of good men, and good men are 
      inclined towards good things, these are innocent of all that the 
      calumniators allege. For them is forgiveness and an honourable provision. 
      <BR>27. O ye who believe ! Enter not houses other than your own until you 
      have asked leave and saluted the inmates thereof. That is better for you 
      that you may be heedful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
