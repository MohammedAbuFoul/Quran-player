    <TD>92. You cannot attain to righteousness unless you spend out of that 
      which you love; and whatever you spend, ALLAH surely knows it well. 
      <BR>93. All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Israel 
      forbade himself before the Torah was sent down. Say, `Bring, then, the 
      Torah and read it, if you are truthful.' <BR>94. Now whoso forges a lie 
      against ALLAH after this, then it is these that are the wrongdoers. 
      <BR>95. Say, `ALLAH has declared the truth; follow, therefore, the 
      religion of Abraham who was ever inclined to ALLAH, and he was not of 
      those who associated gods with Him.' <BR>96. Surely the first House 
      founded for all mankind is that at Becca, abounding in blessings and a 
      guidance for all peoples. <BR>97. In it are manifest Signs; it is the 
      place of Abraham; and whoso enters it, is safe. And pilgrimage to the 
      House is a duty which men - those who can find a way thither - owe to 
      ALLAH. And whoso disbelieves, let him remember that ALLAH is surely 
      Independent of all creatures. <BR>98. Say, `O People of the Book ! why 
      deny ye the signs of ALLAH, while ALLAH is Witness of what you do ? 
      <BR>99. Say, `O People of the Book ! why hinder ye the believers from the 
      path of ALLAH, seeking to make it crooked, while you are witnesses thereof 
      ? And ALLAH is not unmindful of what you do.' <BR>100. O ye who believe ! 
      if you obey any party of those who have been given the Book, they will 
      turn you again into disbelievers after you have 
  believed.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
