    <TD>19. Is he, then, who knows that what has been revealed to thee from 
      thy Lord is the truth, like one who is blind ? But only those gifted with 
      understanding take heed; <BR>20. Those who fulfill ALLAH's pact, and break 
      not the covenant; <BR>21. And those who join what ALLAH has commanded to 
      be joined, and fear their Lord, and dread the evil reckoning; <BR>22. And 
      those who persevere in seeking the favour of their Lord, and observe 
      Prayer, and spend out of that with which WE have provided them, secretly 
      and openly, and repel evil with good. It is these who shall have the best 
      reward of the final abode - <BR>23. Gardens of Eternity. They shall enter 
      them and also those who are righteous from among their fathers, and their 
      wives and their children. And the angels shall enter unto them from every 
      gate, saying, <BR>24. `Peace be unto you, because you were steadfast; 
      behold, how excellent is the reward of the final abode !' <BR>25. And 
      those who break the covenant of ALLAH, after having established it and cut 
      asunder what ALLAH has commanded to be joined, and act corruptly in the 
      earth, on them is the curse of ALLAH and they shall have a grievous abode. 
      <BR>26. ALLAH enlarges HIS provision and straitens it for whomsoever HE 
      pleases. And they rejoice in the present life, while the present life is 
      but a temporary enjoyment as compared with the Hereafter. <BR>27. And 
      those who disbelieves say, `Why is not a Sign sent down to him from his 
      Lord ?' Say, `ALLAH leaves to go astray whom HE wills and guides to 
      Himself those who turn to Him; <BR>28. `Those who believe, and whose 
      hearts find comfort in the remembrance of ALLAH. Aye ! It is the 
      remembrance of ALLAH that hearts can find 
comfort;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
