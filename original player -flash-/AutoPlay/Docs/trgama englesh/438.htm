    <TD>31. And the Book which WE have revealed to thee is the truth itself, 
      fulfilling that which is before it. Surely, ALLAH is All-Aware of HIS 
      servants, All-Seeing concerning HIS servants. <BR>32. Then WE have always 
      made inheritors of the Book those of Our servants whom WE choose. Some of 
      them are hard upon themselves and of them are some who take the middle 
      course, and of them are some who excel others in deeds of goodness by 
      ALLAH's leave. And that indeed is the great grace from ALLAH. <BR>33. 
      Their reward will be Gardens of Eternity. They will enter them and will be 
      adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearl; and their garments 
      therein will be of silk. <BR>34. And they will say, `All praise belongs to 
      ALLAH Who has removed all grief from us. Surely, our Lord is Most 
      Forgiving, Most Appreciating; <BR>35. `Who has, out of HIS bounty, settled 
      us in the Abode of Eternity, where no toil will touch us, nor any sense of 
      weariness affect us therein.' <BR>36. But as for those who disbelieve, for 
      them is the fire of Hell. Death will not be decreed for them so that they 
      may die; nor will the punishment thereof be lightened for them. Thus do WE 
      requite every ungrateful person. <BR>37. And they will cry for help 
      therein: `Our Lord, take us out, we will do righteous deeds other than 
      those we used to do.' ALLAH will say to them, `Did WE not give you a life 
      long enough so that he, who would take heed, could take heed therein ? And 
      there came unto you a Warner too. So taste ye the punishment; for the 
      wrongdoers have no helper.' <BR>38. Verily, ALLAH knows all that is hidden 
      in the heavens and the earth and HE knows well what passes in the minds of 
      people.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
