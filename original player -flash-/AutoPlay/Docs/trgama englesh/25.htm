    <TD>164. Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the 
      alternation of the night and the day, and in the ships that sail the sea 
      with that which profits men, and in the water which ALLAH sends down from 
      the sky and quickens therewith the earth after its death and scatters 
      therein all kinds of beasts, and in the change of the winds and the clouds 
      pressed into service between the heaven and the earth - are indeed Signs 
      for the people who use their understanding.<BR>165. And there are some 
      among men who take for themselves objects of worship other than ALLAH, 
      loving them as they should love ALLAH. But believers are stronger in their 
      love for ALLAH. And if those who transgress could now see the time when 
      they shall see the punishment, they would realize that all power belongs 
      to ALLAH and that ALLAH is severe in punishing.<BR>166. Could they but see 
      when those who were followed shall disown their followers and shall see 
      the punishment and all their ties shall be cut asunder. <BR>167. And those 
      who followed shall say, `If we could only return, we would disown them 
      even as they have disowned us.' Thus will ALLAH show them their works as 
      anguish for them, and that they shall not get out of the fire. <BR>168. O 
      ye men ! eat of what is lawful and good in the earth; and follow not the 
      footsteps of Satan, surely he is to you an open enemy. <BR>169. He enjoins 
      upon you only what is evil and what is foul, and that you say of ALLAH 
      what you do not know.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
