    <TD>31. Verily, for the righteous is decreed a triumph - <BR>32. Walled 
      gardens and grapevines, <BR>33. And young maidens of equal age, <BR>34. 
      And over-flowing cups. <BR>35. Therein they will hear no vain discourse 
      nor lying; <BR>36. A recompense from thy Lord - a gift amply sufficient - 
      <BR>37. Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, 
      the Gracious God. They shall not have the power to address HIM. <BR>38. On 
      the day when the Spirit and the angels will stand in rows, they shall not 
      speak, except he whom the Gracious God will grant leave, and who will 
      speak only what is right. <BR>39. That day is sure to come. So let him, 
      who will, seek recourse unto his Lord. <BR>40. Verily, WE have warned you 
      of a punishment which is near at hand - a day when man will see what his 
      hands have sent on before and the disbeliever will say, `Would that I were 
      mere dust !' <BR>&nbsp;

      1. By those who draw people to the true faith vigorously, <BR>2. And by 
      those who tie their knots firmly, <BR>3. And by those who glide along 
      swiftly, <BR>4. Then they advance and greatly excel others, <BR>5. Then 
      they administer affairs in an excellent manner; <BR>6. This will be on the 
      day when the quaking earth shall quake, <BR>7. And a second quaking shall 
      follow it. <BR>8. On that day hearts will tremble, <BR>9. And their eyes 
      will be cast down. <BR>10. They say, `Shall we really be restored to our 
      former state ? <BR>11. `What ! even when we are rotten bones ?' <BR>12. 
      They say, `Then that, indeed, would be a losing return.' <BR>13. It will 
      only be a single cry, <BR>14. And behold ! they will all come out in the 
      open. <BR>15. Has the story of Moses reached thee 
?&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
