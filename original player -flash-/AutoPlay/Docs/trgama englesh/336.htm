    <TD>31. Devoting all your worship and obedience to ALLAH, not associating 
      anything with HIM. And whoso associate anything with ALLAH, falls, as it 
      were, from a height, and the birds snatch him away or the wind blows him 
      away to a far off-place. <BR>32. The truth is that whoso honours the 
      sacred Signs of ALLAH - that, indeed, proceeds from the righteousness of 
      hearts. <BR>33. In these offerings are benefits for you for an appointed 
      term, then their place of sacrifice is at the Ancient House. <BR>34. And 
      for every people WE have appointed rites of Sacrifice, that they might 
      mention the name of ALLAH over the quadrupeds of the class of cattle that 
      HE has provided for them. So your God is One God, therefore, submit ye all 
      to HIM. And give thou glad tidings to the humble, <BR>35. Whose hearts are 
      filled with awe when the name of ALLAH is mentioned, and who patiently 
      endure whatever befalls them, and who observe Prayer and spend out of what 
      WE have bestowed upon them. <BR>36. And among the sacred Signs of ALLAH WE 
      have appointed for you the sacrificial camels. In them there is much good 
      for you. So mention the name of ALLAH over them as they stand tied up in 
      rows. And when they fall down dead on their sides, eat thereof and feed 
      him who is needy but contented and him also who supplicates. Thus have WE 
      subjected them to you, that you may be grateful. <BR>37. Their flesh 
      reaches not ALLAH, nor does their blood, but it is your righteousness that 
      reaches HIM. Thus HE has subjected them to you, that you may glorify ALLAH 
      for HIS guiding you. And give glad tidings to those who do good. <BR>38. 
      Surely, ALLAH defends those who believe. Surely, ALLAH loves not anyone 
      who is perfidious, 
ungrateful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
