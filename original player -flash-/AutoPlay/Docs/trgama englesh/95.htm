    <TD>102. And when thou art among them, and leadest the Prayer for them, 
      let a party of them stand with thee and let them take their arms. And when 
      they have performed their prostrations, let them go to your rear, and let 
      another party, who have not yet prayed, come forward and pray with thee, 
      and let them take their means of defence and their arms. The disbelievers 
      wish that you were neglectful of your arms and your baggage that they may 
      fall upon you at once. And it shall be no sin for you, because of the 
      inconvenience caused by rain or because you are sick, that you lay aside 
      your arms. But you should always take your precautions. Surely, ALLAH has 
      prepared an humiliating punishment for the disbelievers. <BR>103. And when 
      you have finished the Prayer, remember ALLAH, standing and sitting, and 
      laying on your sides. And when you are secure from danger, then observe 
      Prayer in the prescribe form; verily Prayer is enjoined on the believers 
      to be performed at fixed hours. <BR>104. And slacken not in seeking these 
      people. If you suffer, they too suffer even as you suffer. But you hope 
      from ALLAH what they hope not. And ALLAH is All-Knowing, Wise. <BR>105. WE 
      have surely sent down to thee the Book comprising the truth, that thou 
      mayest judge between men by what ALLAH has taught thee. And be not thou a 
      disputer on behalf of the 
faithless;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
