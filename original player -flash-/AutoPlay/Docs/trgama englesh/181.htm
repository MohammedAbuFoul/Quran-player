    <TD>34. And what excuse have they now that ALLAH should not punish them, 
      when they hinder men from the Sacred Mosque, and they are not its true 
      guardians ? Its true guardians are only those who are righteous, but most 
      of them know not. <BR>35. And their prayer at the Sacred House is nothing 
      but whistling and clapping of hands. `Taste then the punishment because 
      you disbelieved.' <BR>36. Surely, those who disbelieve, spend their wealth 
      to turn people away from the way of ALLAH. They will surely continue to 
      spend it; but then shall it become a source of regret for them, and then 
      shall they be overcome. And the disbelievers shall be gathered unto Hell; 
      <BR>37. That ALLAH may separate the bad from the good, and put the bad, 
      one upon another, and heap them up altogether, and then cast them into 
      Hell. These indeed are the losers. <BR>38. Say to those who disbelieve, if 
      they desist, that which is past will be forgiven them; and if they return 
      to their misdeeds, then verily the example of the former peoples has 
      already gone before them. <BR>39. And fight them until there is no 
      persecution and religion is wholly to ALLAH. But if they desist, then 
      surely ALLAH is Watchful of what they do. <BR>40. And if they turn back, 
      then know that ALLAH is your Protector - an excellent protector and an 
      excellent Helper !</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
