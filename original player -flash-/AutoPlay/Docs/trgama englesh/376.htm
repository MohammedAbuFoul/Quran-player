    <TD>207. Of what avail will be to them that which they were allowed to 
      enjoy ? <BR>208. And never did WE destroy any township but it had its 
      Warners. <BR>209. So that they may be admonished; and WE are not unjust. 
      <BR>210. And the evil ones have not brought it down; <BR>211. It does 
      neither suit them nor have they the power to produce it. <BR>212. Surely, 
      they are debarred from listening to the Divine Word. <BR>213. Call not, 
      therefore, on any other god beside ALLAH, lest thou become one of those 
      who are punished, <BR>214. And warn thy nearest kinsmen, <BR>215. And 
      lower thy wing of mercy to the believers who follow thee. <BR>216. Then if 
      they disobey thee, say, `I repudiate all connection with what you do.' 
      <BR>217. And put thy trust in the Mighty, the Merciful, <BR>218. Who sees 
      thee when thou standest in Prayer, <BR>219. And Who sees thy movements 
      among those who prostrate themselves before ALLAH. <BR>220. HE is indeed 
      the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. <BR>221. Shall I inform you on whom the 
      evil ones descend ? <BR>222. They descend on every lying sinner. <BR>223. 
      They strain their ears towards heaven, and most of them are liars. 
      <BR>224. And as for the poets - it is the erring ones who follow them. 
      <BR>225. Dost thou not see how they wonder aimlessly in every valley, 
      <BR>226. And that they say what they do not ? <BR>227. Save those who 
      believe and do righteous deeds, and remember ALLAH much, and defend 
      themselves after they are wronged. And the wrongdoers shall soon know to 
      what place of return they shall 
return.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
