    <TD>98. Why was there no town, which believed so that their belief should 
      have profited them, save the people of Jonah ? When they believed, We 
      removed from them the punishment of disgrace in the present life, and WE 
      gave them provision for a while. <BR>99. And if thy Lord had enforced HIS 
      Will, surely, all who are in the earth would have believed together. Wilt 
      thou, then, force men to become believers ? <BR>100. And no soul can 
      believe except by the permission of ALLAH. And HE causes HIS wrath to 
      descend on those who would not use their judgment. <BR>101. Say, `Ponder 
      over what is happening in the heavens and the earth.' But the Signs and 
      warning avail not a people who will not believe. <BR>102. What, then, do 
      they wait for, save the like of the days of punishment suffered by those 
      who passed away before them ? Say, `Wait, then, I am with you among those 
      who wait.' <BR>103. Then shall WE save Our Messengers and those who 
      believe. Thus have WE made it incumbent on US to save the believers. 
      <BR>104. Say, `O ye men, if you are in doubt concerning my religion, then 
      know that I worship not those whom you worship instead of ALLAH, but I 
      worship ALLAH alone who causes you to die and I have been commanded to be 
      of the believers; <BR>105. `And I have also been commanded to convey to 
      you God's command: `Set thy face toward religion as one ever inclined to 
      ALLAH, and be not of those who ascribe partners to Him. <BR>106. `And call 
      not, besides ALLAH, on any other that can neither profit thee nor harm 
      thee. And if thou didst so, thou wouldst then certainly be of the 
      wrongdoers.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
