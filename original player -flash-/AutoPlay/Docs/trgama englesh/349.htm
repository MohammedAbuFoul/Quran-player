    <TD>105. It will be said to them, `Were not MY Signs recited unto you, and 
      you treated them as lies ?' <BR>106. They will say, `Our Lord, our ill 
      fortune overwhelmed us, and we were an erring people, <BR>107. `Our Lord, 
      take us out of this, then if we revert to disobedience, we shall, indeed, 
      be wrongdoers.' <BR>108. ALLAH will say, `Away with you, despised therein, 
      and speak not unto ME; <BR>109. `There was a party of MY servants who 
      said, `Our Lord, we believe; forgive us therefore our sins, and have mercy 
      on us; for thou art the Best of those who show mercy; <BR>110. `But you 
      ridiculed them so much so that ridicule of them caused you to forget MY 
      remembrance while you continued to laugh at them; <BR>111. `I have 
      rewarded them this day for their patient endurance; they are, indeed, the 
      ones who have achieved bliss.' <BR>112. ALLAH will then say, `What number 
      of years did you tarry in the earth ?' <BR>113. They will say, `We tarried 
      for a day or part of a day, but ask those who keep count.' <BR>114. HE 
      will say, `You tarried but a little, if only you knew !' <BR>115. What ! 
      Did you then think that WE had created you without purpose, and that you 
      would not be brought back to US ? <BR>116. Exalted be ALLAH, the True 
      King. There is no god but HE, the Lord of the Glorious Throne. <BR>117. 
      And he, who calls on another god along with ALLAH, for which he has no 
      proof, shall have to render an account to his Lord. Certainly the 
      disbelievers do not prosper. <BR>118. And say, `My Lord, forgive and have 
      mercy, and Thou art the Best of those who show 
mercy.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
