    <TD>82. And WE subjected to him deep divers who dived for him, and did 
      other works besides that; and it was WE Who guarded them. <BR>83. And call 
      to mind Job when he cried to his Lord, `Distress has afflicted me, and 
      Thou art the Most Merciful of all who show mercy.' <BR>84. So WE heard his 
      prayer and removed the distress from which he suffered, and WE restored to 
      him his family and the like thereof with them, as a mercy from US, and as 
      an admonition to the worshippers. <BR>85. And call to mind Ishmael and 
      Idris and Dhu'l-Kifl. All were men of patience. <BR>86. And WE admitted 
      them to OUR mercy. Surely, they were of the righteous ones. <BR>87. And 
      remember Dhu'l-Nun, when he went away in anger, and he was sure in his 
      mind that WE would not cause him distress and he cried out in the midst of 
      his afflictions: `There is no god but Thou, Holy art Thou. I have indeed 
      been of the wrongdoers.' <BR>88. So WE heard his prayer and delivered him 
      from his distress. And thus do WE deliver true believers. <BR>89. And 
      remember Zachariah also when he cried to his Lord: `My Lord, leave me not 
      alone and Thou art the Best of inheritors.' <BR>90. So WE heard his prayer 
      and bestowed upon him John and cured his wife of sterility for him. They 
      used to vie with one another in good works and they called on US in hope 
      and in fear, and they humbled themselves before 
US.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
