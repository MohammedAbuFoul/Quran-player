    <TD>107. And if ALLAH afflicts thee with harm, there is none who can 
      remove it but HE; and if HE intends good for thee, there is none who can 
      repel HIS grace. HE causes it to reach whomsoever of His servants HE 
      wills. And HE is the Most Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>108. Say, `O men, now 
      has the truth come to you from your Lord. So whoever follow the guidance, 
      follows it only for the good of his own soul, and whoever errs, errs only 
      against it. And I am not a keeper over you.' <BR>109. And follow that 
      which is revealed to thee and be steadfast until ALLAH gives HIS judgment. 
      And ALLAH is the Best of judges. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. Alif Lam Ra. This is a Book, whose verses have been made firm and free 
      from imperfection and then they have been expounded in detail. It is from 
      One Wise, and All-Aware. <BR>2. It teaches that you should worship none 
      but ALLAH - I am to you a Warner; and a bearer of glad tidings from Him -- 
      <BR>3. And that you seek forgiveness of your Lord, and then turn to HIM. 
      HE will provide for you a goodly provision until an appointed term. And HE 
      will grant HIS grace to everyone possessed of merit. And if you turn away, 
      then surely I fear for you the punishment of a dreadful day. <BR>4. To 
      ALLAH is your return; and HE has full power over all things. <BR>5. Now 
      surely, they fold up their breast that they may hide their evil thoughts 
      from HIM. Aye, even when they cover themselves up with their garments, HE 
      knows what they hide and what they reveal. Surely, HE knows full well what 
      is in their breast. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
