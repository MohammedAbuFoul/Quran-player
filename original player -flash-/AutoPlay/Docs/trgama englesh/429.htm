    <TD>8. `Has he forged a lie against ALLAH or is he afflicted with madness 
      ?' Nay, but those who believe not in the Hereafter are already suffering 
      the punishment and are too far gone in error. <BR>9. Do they not see how 
      they are encompassed by that which is before them and that which is behind 
      them of the heaven and the earth ? If WE please, WE could cause the earth 
      to sink with them, or cause pieces of the sky to fall upon them. In that 
      verily is a Sign for every repentant servant of ALLAH. <BR>10. And 
      certainly, We bestowed grace upon David from US and said, `O ye mountains, 
      celebrate the praises of ALLAH with him, and O birds, ye also.' And WE 
      made the iron soft for him, <BR>11. And WE said, `Make thou full-length 
      coats of mail, and make the rings of a proper measure. And act 
      righteously, surely I see all that you do.' <BR>12. And to Solomon WE 
      subjected the wind; its morning course was a month's journey and its 
      evening course was a month's journey too. And WE caused a fount of molten 
      copper to flow for him. And of the jinn were some who worked under him by 
      the command of his Lord. And WE said that whoever of them turned away from 
      Our command, WE would make him taste the punishment of the burning fire. 
      <BR>13. They made for him what he desired - places of worship and statues, 
      and basins like reservoirs, and large cooking vessels fixed in their 
      places. And WE said, act gratefully, O House of David, but few of MY 
      servants are grateful. <BR>14. And when WE decreed his (Solomon's) death, 
      nothing indicated to them that he was dead save a worm of the earth that 
      ate away his staff. So when it fell down, the jinn plainly realized that 
      if they had known the unseen, they would not have remained in a state of 
      degrading torment.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
