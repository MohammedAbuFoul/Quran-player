    <TD>45. And WE sent to Thamud their brother Salih who said, `Worship 
      ALLAH.' And at once they became two parties contending with each other. 
      <BR>46. He said, `O my people, why do you seek to hasten on evil rather 
      than good ? Wherefore do you not ask forgiveness of ALLAH that you may be 
      shown mercy ?' <BR>47. They said, `We augur ill of thee and of those that 
      are with thee.' He said, `The true cause of your ill-fortune is with 
      ALLAH, but you are a people who are on trial.' <BR>48. And there were in 
      the city a party of nine persons who made mischief in the land, and who 
      would not reform. <BR>49. They said, `Swear one to another by ALLAH that 
      we will surely attack him and his family by night, and then we will say to 
      his heir, `We witnessed not the destruction of his family, and most surely 
      we are truthful.' <BR>50. And they planned a plan, And WE also planned a 
      plan, but they perceived it not. <BR>51. Then see how evil was the end of 
      their plan ! Verily, WE utterly destroyed them and their people all 
      together. <BR>52. And yonder are their houses fallen down because of their 
      wrongdoing. In that verily is a Sign for a people who have knowledge. 
      <BR>53. And WE saved those who believed and feared God. <BR>54. And WE 
      sent Lot as a Messenger, when he said to his people, `Do you commit 
      abomination while you see ? <BR>55. What ! do you approach men lustfully 
      rather than women ? Nay, you are indeed an ignorant 
  people.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
