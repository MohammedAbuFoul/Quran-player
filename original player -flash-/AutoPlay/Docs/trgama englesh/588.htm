    <TD>7. Nay, the record of the wicked is in Sijjin. <BR>8. And what should 
      make thee know what Sijjin is ? <BR>9. It is a written Book since 
      eternity. <BR>10. Woe on that day unto those who reject, <BR>11. Who deny 
      the Day of Judgment. <BR>12. And none denies it save every sinful 
      transgressor, <BR>13. Who, when Our Signs are recited unto him, say, 
      `Tales of the ancient !' <BR>14. Nay, but that which they have earned is 
      rust upon their hearts. <BR>15. Nay, they will, surely, be debarred from 
      seeing their Lord on that day. <BR>16. Then, verily, they will burn in 
      Hell, <BR>17. Then it will be said to them, `This is what you used to 
      reject.' <BR>18. Nay, but the record of the righteous is, surely, in 
      `Illiyyin. <BR>19. And what should make thee know what `Illiyyun is ? 
      <BR>20. It is a written Book. <BR>21. The chosen ones of God will witness 
      it. <BR>22. Surely, the righteous will be in bliss, <BR>23. Seated on 
      couches, looking at everything. <BR>24. Thou wilt find in their faces the 
      freshness of bliss. <BR>25. They will be given to drink of a pure 
      beverage, sealed. <BR>26. The sealing of it will be with musk - for this 
      let the aspirants aspire - <BR>27. And it will be tempered with the water 
      of Tasnim, <BR>28. A spring of which the chosen ones will drink. <BR>29. 
      Those who were guilty used to laugh at those who believed, <BR>30. And 
      when they passed by them, they winked at one another, <BR>31. And when 
      they returned to their families they returned exulting; <BR>32. And when 
      they saw them they said, `These, indeed, have gone astray.' <BR>33. But 
      they were not sent as keepers over them. <BR>34. This day, then, it is the 
      believers who will laugh at the 
disbelievers,&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
