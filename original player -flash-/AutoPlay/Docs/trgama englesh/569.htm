    <TD>11. Though they will be placed in sight of one another. The guilty one 
      would fain ransom himself from the punishment of that day by offering his 
      children, <BR>12. And his wife and his brother, <BR>13. And his kinsfolk 
      who gave him shelter, <BR>14. And by offering all those who are on the 
      earth, if only thus he might save himself. <BR>15. But no ! surely, it is 
      a flame of Fire, <BR>16. Stripping off the skin even to the extremities of 
      the body. <BR>17. It shall call him who turned his back and retreated, 
      <BR>18. And hoarded wealth and withheld it. <BR>19. Verily, man is created 
      impatient and miserly. <BR>20. When evil touches him, he is full of 
      lamentations, <BR>21. But when good falls to his lot, he is niggardly, 
      <BR>22. Except those who pray, <BR>23. Those who are constant in their 
      Prayer; <BR>24. And those in whose wealth there is a known right <BR>25. 
      For those who ask for help and for those who do not ask <BR>26. And those 
      who believe in the Day of Judgment to be a reality; <BR>27. And those who 
      are fearful of the punishment of their Lord - <BR>28. Verily, from the 
      punishment of their Lord none can feel secure - <BR>29. And those who 
      guard their private parts - <BR>30. Except from their wives and from those 
      whom their right hands possess; such indeed, are not to blame; <BR>31. But 
      those who seek to go beyond that, it is these who are transgressors - 
      <BR>32. And those who are watchful of their trusts and their covenants; 
      <BR>33. And those who are upright in their testimonies. <BR>34. And those 
      who are strict in the observance of their Prayer. <BR>35. These will be in 
      the Gardens, duly honoured. <BR>36. But what is the matter with those who 
      disbelieve that they come hurrying on towards thee, <BR>37. From the right 
      hand and from the left, in different parties ? <BR>38. Does every man 
      among them hope to enter the Garden of Bliss ? <BR>39. Never ! WE have 
      created them of that which they 
know.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
