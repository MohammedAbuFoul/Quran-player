    <TD>36. So when the Queen's envoy came to Solomon, he said, `Do you 
      presume to help me with your wealth ? But that which ALLAH has given me is 
      better than that which HE has given you. Nay, you take pride in your gift; 
      <BR>37. `Go back to them, for we shall surely come to them with hosts 
      against which they will have no power of resistance, and we shall drive 
      them out of their land disgraced, and they will be humbled.' <BR>38. He 
      said, `O nobles, which of you will bring me her throne before they come to 
      me submitting ?' <BR>39. A powerful chieftain from among the jinn said, `I 
      will bring it to thee before thou strikest thy camp; and indeed I possess 
      power therefor and I am trustworthy.' <BR>40. Said one who had knowledge 
      of the book, `I will bring it to thee before thy noble envoy returns to 
      thee.' And when he saw it set before him, he said, `This is of the grace 
      of my Lord, that HE may try me whether I am grateful or ungrateful. And 
      whosoever is grateful is grateful for the good of his own soul; but 
      whosoever is ungrateful, truly, my Lord is Self-Sufficient, Gracious.' 
      <BR>41. He said, `Make the throne so beautiful as to make her own throne 
      appear quite ordinary to her, and let us see whether she follows the right 
      way or whether she is one of those who follow not the right way.' <BR>42. 
      And when she came, it was said to her, `Is thy throne like this ?' She 
      replied, `It is as though it were the same. And we had been given 
      knowledge before this, and we have already submitted.' <BR>43. And that 
      which she used to worship beside ALLAH prevented her from believing; for 
      she came of a disbelieving people. <BR>44. It was said to her, `Enter the 
      palace.' And when she saw it, she thought it to be a great expanse of 
      water, and she bared her shanks. Solomon said, `It is a palace paved 
      smooth with slabs of glass.' She said, `My Lord, indeed I have wronged my 
      soul; and I submit myself with Solomon to ALLAH, the Lord of the 
    worlds.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
