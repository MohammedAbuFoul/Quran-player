    <TD>1. By the heaven and the Morning Star - <BR>2. And what should make 
      thee know what the Morning Star is ? <BR>3. It is the star of piercing 
      brightness - <BR>4. There is not a soul but has a guardian over it. <BR>5. 
      So let man consider of what he is created. <BR>6. He is created of a 
      gushing fluid, <BR>7. Which issues forth from between the loins and the 
      breastbones. <BR>8. Surely, ALLAH has the power to bring him back to life, 
      <BR>9. On the day when secrets shall be disclosed. <BR>10. And he shall 
      have no strength and no helper. <BR>11. By the cloud which gives rain 
      repeatedly, <BR>12. And by the earth which opens out with herbage. <BR>13. 
      Surely, the Qur'an is a decisive word. <BR>14. And it is not a vain talk. 
      <BR>15. Surely, they plan a plan, <BR>16. And I also plan a plan. <BR>17. 
      So give respite to the disbelievers. Aye respite them for a little while. 
      <BR>&nbsp;

      1. Glorify the name of thy Lord, the Most High, <BR>2. Who creates man and 
      perfects him. <BR>3. And Who determines his capacities and furnishes him 
      with appropriate guidance. <BR>4. And Who brings forth the pasturage, 
      <BR>5. Then turns it into black stubble. <BR>6. WE shall teach thee the 
      Qur'an and thou shalt not forget it, <BR>7. Except as what ALLAH wills. 
      Surely, HE knows what is manifest and what is hidden. <BR>8. And WE shall 
      provide thee with every facility. <BR>9. So keep on admonishing people. 
      Surely, admonition is, indeed, profitable. <BR>10. He who fears will heed; 
      <BR>11. But the most wretched will turn aside from it, <BR>12. He who will 
      enter the great Fire. <BR>13. Then he will neither die therein nor live. 
      <BR>14. Verily, he, indeed, will prosper who purifies himself, <BR>15. And 
      remembers the name of his Lord and offer 
Prayers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
