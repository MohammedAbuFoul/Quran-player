    <TD>6. HE created you from a single being; then from that HE made its 
      mate; and HE has sent down for you of the cattle eight pairs. HE creates 
      you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation, through three 
      stages of darkness. This is ALLAH, your Lord. HIS is the Kingdom. There is 
      no god but HE. Wither then are you being turned away ? <BR>7. If you are 
      ungrateful, surely ALLAH is Self-Sufficient, being independent of you. And 
      HE is not pleased with ingratitude in HIS servants. But if you are 
      grateful, HE likes it in you. And no bearer of burden shall bear the 
      burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return; and HE will inform 
      you of what you have been doing. Surely, HE knows full well all that is 
      hidden in the breasts. <BR>8. And when an affliction befalls man, he calls 
      upon his Lord, turning penitently to HIM. Then, when HE confers upon him a 
      favour from Himself, he forgets what he used to pray for before, and 
      starts assigning rivals to ALLAH, that he may lead people astray from HIS 
      way. Say, `Profit from thy disbelief a little; while in the end thou art, 
      surely, of the inmates of the Fire.' <BR>9. Is he who prays devoutly to 
      ALLAH in the hours of the night, prostrating himself and standing in 
      Prayer and fears the Hereafter and hopes for the mercy of his Lord, like 
      him who is disobedient ? Say, `Are those who know equal to those who know 
      not ?' Verily, only those endowed with understanding will take heed. 
      <BR>10. Say, `O ye MY servants who believe, fear your Lord. There is good 
      for those who do good in this life. And ALLAH's earth is spacious. Verily, 
      the steadfast will have their reward without 
measure.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
