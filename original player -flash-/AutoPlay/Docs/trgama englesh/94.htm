    <TD>95. Those of the believers who sit at home, excepting the disabled 
      ones, and those who strive in the cause of ALLAH with their wealth and 
      their persons, are not equal. ALLAH has exalted in rank those who strive 
      with their wealth and their persons above those who sit at home. And to 
      each ALLAH has promised good. And ALLAH has exalted those who strive above 
      those who sit at home, by a great reward - <BR>96. By degrees of 
      excellence bestowed by HIM, and by special forgiveness and mercy. And 
      ALLAH is Most Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>97. Verily, those whom the angels 
      cause to die while they are wronging their own souls, the angels will say 
      to them : `What were you after ?' They will say : `We were treated as weak 
      in the land.' The angels will say, `Was not ALLAH's earth spacious enough 
      so that you could have emigrated therein ?' It is these whose abode shall 
      be Hell, and an evil destination it is; <BR>98. Except such weak ones 
      among men, women and children, as are incapable of adopting any plan or of 
      finding any way to escape. <BR>99. As to these, maybe ALLAH will efface 
      their sins; for ALLAH is the Effacer of sins, the Most Forgiving. <BR>100. 
      And whoso emigrates from his country in the way of ALLAH will find in the 
      earth an abundant place of refuge and plentifulness. And whoso goes forth 
      from his home, emigrating in the cause of ALLAH and HIS Messenger, and 
      death overtakes him, his reward lies on ALLAH, and ALLAH is Most 
      Forgiving, Merciful, <BR>101. And when you journey in the land, it shall 
      be no blame on you if you shorten the Prayer, if you fear that those who 
      disbelieve will cause you trouble. Verily the disbelievers are an open 
      enemy to you.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
