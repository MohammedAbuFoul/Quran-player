    <TD>12. Verily, ALLAH will cause those who believe and do good works to 
      enter the Gardens underneath which streams flow; While those who 
      disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat even as the cattle eat, and the Fire 
      will be their last resort. <BR>13. And how many a township, mightier than 
      thy town which has driven thee out, have WE destroyed, and they had no 
      helper. <BR>14. Then, is he who takes his stand upon a clear proof from 
      his Lord like those to whom the evil of their deeds is made to look 
      attractive and who follow their low desires ? <BR>15. A description of the 
      Garden promised to the righteous: Therein are streams of water which 
      corrupts not; and streams of milk of which the taste changes not; and 
      streams of wine, a delight to those who drink; and streams of clarified 
      honey. And in it they will have all kinds of fruit, and forgiveness from 
      their Lord. Can those who enjoy such bliss be like those who abide in the 
      Fire and who are given boiling water to drink so that it tears their 
      bowels ? <BR>16. And among them are some who seems to listen to thee till, 
      when they go forth from thy presence, they say to those who have been 
      given knowledge, `What has he been talking about just now ?' These are 
      they upon whose hearts ALLAH has set a seal, and who follow their own evil 
      desires. <BR>17. But as for those who follow guidance, HE adds to their 
      guidance, and bestows on them righteousness suited to their condition. 
      <BR>18. The disbelievers wait not but for the Hour, that it should come 
      upon them suddenly. The Signs thereof have already come. But of what avail 
      will their admonition be to them when it has actually come upon them. 
      <BR>19. Know, therefore, that there is no god other than ALLAH, and ask 
      protection for thy human frailties, and for believing men and believing 
      women. And ALLAH knows the place where you move about and the place where 
      you stay.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
