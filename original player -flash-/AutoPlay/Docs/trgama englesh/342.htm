    <TD>1. Successful indeed are the believers, <BR>2. Who are humble in their 
      Prayers, <BR>3. And who shun all that which is vain, <BR>4. And who are 
      prompt and regular in paying the Zakat, <BR>5. And who guard their 
      chastity - <BR>6. Except from their wives or what their right hands 
      possess, for then they are not to be blamed; <BR>7. But those, who seek 
      anything beyond that are the transgressors - <BR>8. And who are watchful 
      of their trusts and their covenants, <BR>9. And who are strict in the 
      observance of their Prayers. <BR>10. These are the heirs, <BR>11. Who will 
      inherit Paradise. They will abide therein for ever. <BR>12. Verily, WE 
      created man from an extract of clay; <BR>13. Then WE placed him as a drop 
      of sperm in a safe depository; <BR>14. Then WE fashioned the sperm into a 
      clot; then WE fashioned the clot into a shapeless lump; then WE fashioned 
      bones out of this shapeless lump; Then WE clothed the bones with flesh; 
      Then WE developed it into another creation. So blessed be ALLAH, the Best 
      of creators. <BR>15. Then after that you, surely, must die. <BR>16. Then 
      on the Day of Resurrection you shall, surely, be raised up. <BR>17. And WE 
      have created above you seven ways, and WE are never neglectful of the 
      creation.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
