    <TD>87. Except through the special mercy of thy Lord. Surely, great is HIS 
      grace on thee. <BR>88. Say, `If men and jinn should gather together to 
      produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof, 
      even though they should help one another.' <BR>89. And surely We have set 
      forth for mankind in various ways all kinds of similitudes in this Qur'an, 
      but most men would reject everything in respect of it but disbelief. 
      <BR>90. And they say, `We will not believe in thee until thou cause a 
      spring to gush forth for us from the earth; <BR>91. `Or, thou have a 
      garden of date-palms and vines and cause streams to gush forth in the 
      midst thereof in abundance; <BR>92. `Or, thou cause the heaven to fall 
      upon us in pieces, as thou hast claimed, or, thou bring ALLAH and the 
      angels before us face to face; <BR>93. `Or, thou have a house of gold or 
      thou ascend up into heaven; and we will not believe in thy ascension until 
      thou send down to us a Book that we can read.' Say, `Holy is my Lord ! I 
      am but a mortal sent as a Messenger.' <BR>94. And nothing prevents people 
      from believing when the guidance comes to them save that they say, `Has 
      ALLAH sent a man like us as a Messenger ?' <BR>95. Say, `Had there been in 
      the earth angels walking about in peace and quiet, WE would have certainly 
      sent down to them from heaven an angel as a Messenger.' <BR>96. Say, 
      `Sufficient is ALLAH for a Witness between me and you; surely, HE knows 
      and sees HIS servants full 
well.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
