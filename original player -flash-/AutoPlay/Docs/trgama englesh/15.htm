    <TD>94. Say `If the abode of the Hereafter with ALLAH is solely for you to 
      the exclusion of all other people, then wish for death if you are 
      truthful.' <BR>95. But never shall they wish for it, because of what their 
      own hands have sent on before them; and ALLAH knows the wrongdoers 
      well.<BR>96. And thou shalt surely find them of all people, the most 
      covetous of life, even more than those who set up equals with God. Every 
      one of them wishes that he may be granted a life of a thousand years, but 
      his being granted such a life shall not remove him further away from the 
      punishment; and ALLAH sees all they do. <BR>97. Say `Whoever is an enemy 
      to Gabriel' - for he it is who has caused it to descend on thy heart by 
      the command of ALLAH, fulfilling that revelation which precedes it, and is 
      a guidance and glad tidings to the believers. <BR>98. `Whoever is an enemy 
      to ALLAH, and HIS angels, and HIS Messengers, and Gabriel, and Michael, 
      then surely, ALLAH is an enemy to such disbelievers.' <BR>99. And surely 
      WE have sent down to thee manifest Signs, and none disbelieves in them but 
      the disobedient.<BR>100. What ! every time they make a covenant, will a 
      party among them throw it aside ? Nay, most of them have no faith. 
      <BR>101. And now that there has come to them a messenger from ALLAH, 
      fulfilling that which is with them, a party of the people to whom the Book 
      was given have thrown the Book of ALLAH behind their backs, as if they 
      know it not.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
