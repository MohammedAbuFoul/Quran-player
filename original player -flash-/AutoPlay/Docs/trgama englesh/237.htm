    <TD>15. So, when they took him away, and agreed to put him into the bottom 
      of a deep well, and carry out the malicious design, WE sent revelation to 
      him, saying, `Thou shalt surely one day tell them of this affair of 
      theirs, and they did not know.' <BR>16. And they came to their father in 
      the evening, weeping. <BR>17. They said, `O my father, we went forth 
      racing with one another and left Joseph with our things, and the wolf 
      devoured him, but thou wilt not believe us though we are telling the 
      truth. <BR>18. And they came with false blood on his shirt. He said, `This 
      what you say is not true but your souls have made a great thing appear 
      light in your eyes. So comely patience is now called for. And it is ALLAH 
      alone Whose help is sought against what you assert.' <BR>19. And there 
      came a caravan of travelers and they sent their water-drawer. And he let 
      down his bucket into the well. `Oh, good news !' said he, `Here is your 
      youth !' And they hid him as a piece of merchandise, and ALLAH well knew 
      what they did. <BR>20. And they sold him for a paltry price, a few 
      dirhems, and they were not at all keen on it. <BR>21. And the man from 
      Egypt who bought him said to his wife, `Make his stay among us honourable. 
      Maybe we will benefit from him or we may adopt him as a son.' And thus did 
      WE establish Joseph in the land, and WE did so that WE might also teach 
      him the interpretation of things. And ALLAH has full power over HIS 
      decree, but most men know not. <BR>22. And when he attained his age of 
      full strength, WE granted him judgment and knowledge. And thus do WE 
      reward those who do good.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
