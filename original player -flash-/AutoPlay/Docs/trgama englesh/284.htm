    <TD>18. Whoso desires the present life, WE hasten for him therein of its 
      provision what WE will - for such of them as WE please; then WE appoint 
      Hell for him; he shall burn therein condemned and rejected. <BR>19. And 
      whoso desires the Hereafter and strives for it as it should be striven for 
      and is a believer - these are the ones whose striving shall be duly 
      appreciated. <BR>20. To all WE render aid - to those as well as to these - 
      a gift from thy Lord. And the gift of thy Lord is not restricted. <BR>21. 
      Behold, how WE have exalted some of them over others in the present life; 
      and surely the Hereafter shall be greater in degrees of rank and greater 
      in excellence. <BR>22. So set up not another god with ALLAH lest thou sit 
      down condemned and forsaken. <BR>23. Thy Lord has commanded that ye 
      worship none but HIM, and that ye show kindness to parents. If one or both 
      of them attain old age with thee, never say to them as much as ugh nor 
      reproach them, but always address them with kindly speech. <BR>24. And 
      lower them the wing of humility out of tenderness. And say, `My Lord, have 
      mercy on them even as they nourished me when I was a little child.' 
      <BR>25. Your Lord knows best what is in your minds, if you are righteous, 
      then surely, HE is Most Forgiving to those who turn to HIM again and 
      again. <BR>26. And give to the kinsman his due, and to the poor and the 
      wayfarer, and squander not thy wealth extravagantly. <BR>27. Verily, the 
      squanderers are brothers of satans and Satan is ungrateful to his 
    Lord.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
