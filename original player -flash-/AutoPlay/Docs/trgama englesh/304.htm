    <TD>98. Thereupon he said, `This is a mercy from my Lord. But when the 
      promise of my Lord shall come to pass, HE will break it into pieces. And 
      the promise of my Lord is certainly true.' <BR>99. And on that day WE 
      shall leave some of them to surge against others, and the trumpet will be 
      blown. Then shall WE gather them all together. <BR>100. And on that day WE 
      shall present Hell, face to face, to the disbelievers <BR>101. Whose eyes 
      were under a veil, not heeding MY reminder and they could not even afford 
      to hear. <BR>102. Do the disbelievers think that they can take MY servants 
      as protectors instead of ME ? Surely, WE have prepared Hell as an 
      entertainment for the disbelievers. <BR>103. Say, `Shall WE tell you of 
      those who are the greatest losers in respect of their works.' <BR>104. 
      `Those whose labour is all lost in pursuit of the life of this world, and 
      yet they imagine that they are doing good works.' <BR>105. Those are they 
      who deny the Signs of their Lord and the meeting with HIM. So their works 
      are vain, and on the Day of Resurrection WE shall give them no weight. 
      <BR>106. That is their reward - Hell; because they disbelieved, and made a 
      jest of MY Signs and MY Messengers. <BR>107. Surely, those who believe and 
      act righteously, will have Gardens of Paradise for an abode, <BR>108. 
      Wherein they will abide; having no desire to be removed therefrom. 
      <BR>109. Say, `If every ocean become ink for the words of my Lord, surely, 
      the ocean would be exhausted before the words of my Lord were exhausted, 
      even though WE brought the like thereof as further help.' <BR>110. Say, I 
      am but a man like yourselves; but it is revealed to me that your God is 
      One God. So let him who hopes to meet his Lord, do good deeds, and let him 
      join no one in the worship of his 
Lord.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
