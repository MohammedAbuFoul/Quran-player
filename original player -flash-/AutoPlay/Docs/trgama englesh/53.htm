    <TD>23. Hast thou not seen those who have been given their portion of the 
      Book ? They are called to the Book of ALLAH that it may judge between 
      them, but a party of them turn away in aversion. <BR>24. That is because 
      they say, `The Fire shall not touch us except for a limited number of 
      days.' And what they used to forge has deceived them regarding their 
      religion. <BR>25. How will it be with them when WE will gather them 
      together on the Day about which there is no doubt; and when every soul 
      will be paid in full what it has earned, and they shall not be wronged ? 
      <BR>26. Say, `O ALLAH, Lord of Sovereignty, Thou givest sovereignty to 
      whomsoever Thou pleasest; and Thou takest away sovereignty from whomsoever 
      Thou pleasest. Thou exaltest whomsoever Thou pleasest and Thou abasest 
      whomsoever Thou pleasest. In Thy hand is all good. Thou surely hast power 
      to do all things. <BR>27. Thou makest the night pass into the day and 
      makest the day pass into the night. And Thou bringest forth the living 
      from the dead and bringest forth the dead from the living. And Thou givest 
      to whomsoever Thou pleasest without measure.' <BR>28. Let not the 
      believers take disbelievers for friends in preference to believers - and 
      whoever does that has no connection with ALLAH - except that you guard 
      yourselves fully against them. And ALLAH cautions you against HIS 
      punishment; and to ALLAH is the returning. <BR>29. Say, `Whether you hide 
      what is in your breasts or reveal it, ALLAH knows it; and HE knows 
      whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And ALLAH has 
      power to do all things.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
