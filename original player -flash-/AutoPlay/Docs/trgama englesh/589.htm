    <TD>35. Seated on couches, gazing around. <BR>36. They will say to one 
      another, `Are not the disbelievers fully requited for what they used to do 
      ?' <BR>&nbsp;
      <HR width="90%" color=#000000 SIZE=3>
      1. When the heaven bursts asunder, <BR>2. And hearkens unto her Lord - and 
      this is incumbent upon her - <BR>3. And when the earth is spread out 
      <BR>4. And cast out all that is in her, and appears to become empty, 
      <BR>5. And hearkens unto her Lord - and this is incumbent upon her - 
      <BR>6. Verily, thou, O man, art toiling along towards thy Lord, a hard 
      toiling; until thou meet HIM. <BR>7. Then as for him who is given his 
      record in his right hand, <BR>8. He will, surely, have an easy reckoning, 
      <BR>9. And he will return to his family, rejoicing. <BR>10. But as for him 
      who will have his record given to him behind his back, <BR>11. He will 
      soon call for destruction, <BR>12. And he will burn in a blazing Fire. 
      <BR>13. Verily, before this he used to pass his time joyfully among his 
      people. <BR>14. He, indeed, thought that he would never return to God. 
      <BR>15. Yea ! surely, his Lord was ever Watchful of him. <BR>16. But nay ! 
      I call to witness the glow of sunset, <BR>17. And the night and all that 
      it envelops, <BR>18. And the moon when it becomes full, <BR>19. That you 
      shall, assuredly, pass on from one stage to another. <BR>20. So what is 
      the matter with them that they believe not, <BR>21. And when the Qur'an is 
      recited unto them, they do not bow in submission; <BR>22. On the contrary, 
      those who disbelieve reject it. <BR>23. And ALLAH knows best what they 
      keep hidden in their hearts. <BR>24. So give them tidings of a painful 
      punishment. <BR>25. But as to those who believe and do good works, theirs 
      is an unending reward.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
