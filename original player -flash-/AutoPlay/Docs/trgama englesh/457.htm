    <TD>62. And the inmates of Hell will say, `What is the matter with us that 
      we see not the men whom we used to reckon among the wicked ? <BR>63. `It 
      is because we unjustly took them for a laughing stock, or have the eyes 
      missed them ?' <BR>64. Surely, this is the truth - the disputing together 
      of the dwellers in the Fire. <BR>65. Say, I am only a Warner; and there is 
      no God but <BR>ALLAH, the One, the Most Supreme; <BR>66. The Lord of the 
      heavens and the earth, and all that is between the two, the Mighty, the 
      Great Forgiver.' <BR>67. Say, `It is a big news, <BR>68. From which you 
      are turning away; <BR>69. `I had no knowledge of the Exalted Assembly when 
      they discussed the matter among themselves, <BR>70. `But this that it has 
      been revealed to me, that I am a plain Warner.' <BR>71. Call to mind when 
      thy Lord said to the angels, I am about to create man from clay; <BR>72. 
      `And so when I fashioned him in perfection, and have breathed into him of 
      My Spirit, fall ye down into submission to him.' <BR>73. So the angels 
      submitted, all of them together. <BR>74. But Iblis did not. He behaved 
      proudly, and was of those who disbelieved. <BR>75. God said, `O Iblis, 
      what hindered thee from submitting to what I had created with MY two hands 
      ? Is it that thou art too proud, or art thou really above obeying my 
      command ?' <BR>76. He said, `I am better than he. Thou hast created me of 
      fire and him hast Thou created of clay.' <BR>77. God said, `Then get out 
      hence, for, surely, thou art rejected; <BR>78. And, surely, on thee shall 
      be MY curse till the Day of Judgment.' <BR>79. He said, `My Lord, then 
      grant me respite till the day when they shall be raised.' <BR>80. God 
      said, `Certainly, thou art of the respited ones, <BR>81. `Till the day of 
      the known time.' <BR>82. He said, `So be Thy glory, I will surely, lead 
      them all astray, <BR>83. `Except thy chosen servants from among 
    them.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
