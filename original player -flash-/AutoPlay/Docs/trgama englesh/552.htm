    <TD>6. And call to mind when Jesus, son of Mary, said, `O children of 
      Israel, surely, I am ALLAH's Messenger unto you, fulfilling that which is 
      before me of the prophecies of the Torah, and giving glad tidings of a 
      Messenger who will come after me, his name being Ahmad. And when he came 
      to them with clear proofs, they said, this is manifest sorcery.' <BR>7. 
      But who does greater wrong than he who forges a lie against ALLAH while he 
      is invited to Islam ? ALLAH guides not the wrongdoing people. <BR>8. They 
      desire to extinguish the light of ALLAH with the breath of their mouths, 
      but ALLAH will perfect HIS light, however much the disbelievers may 
      dislike it. <BR>9. HE it is Who has sent HIS Messenger with the guidance 
      and the Religion of truth, that HE may cause it to prevail over all 
      religions, however much those who associate partners with ALLAH may 
      dislike it. <BR>10. O ye who believe ! shall I point out to you a commerce 
      which will deliver you from a painful punishment ? <BR>11. That you 
      believe in ALLAH and His Messenger, and strive in the cause of ALLAH with 
      your wealth and your persons. That is better for you, if you did but know. 
      <BR>12. HE will forgive you your sins, and admit you to Gardens through 
      which streams flow, and to pure and pleasant dwellings in Gardens of 
      Eternity. That is the supreme triumph, <BR>13. And HE will bestow upon you 
      another favour which you love: help from ALLAH and a nigh victory. So give 
      glad tidings to the believers. <BR>14. O ye who believe ! be helpers of 
      ALLAH, as said Jesus, son of Mary, to his disciples, `Who are my helpers 
      in the cause of ALLAH ?' The disciples said, `We are helpers of ALLAH.' So 
      a party of the Children of Israel believed while a party disbelieved. Then 
      WE aided those who believed against their enemy, and they became 
      predominant.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
