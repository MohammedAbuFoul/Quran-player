    <TD>52. And WE called him from the right side of the Mount and WE made him 
      draw near to US for special communion. <BR>53. And WE bestowed upon him, 
      out of OUR mercy, his brother Aaron whom WE made a Prophet. <BR>54. And 
      relate the story of Ishmael as mentioned in the Book. He was indeed true 
      to his promises. And he was a Messenger, a Prophet. <BR>55. He used to 
      enjoin Prayer and alms-giving on his people, and he was well pleasing to 
      his Lord. <BR>56. And relate the story of Idris as mentioned in the Book. 
      He was a truthful man and a Prophet. <BR>57. And WE exalted him to a lofty 
      station. <BR>58. These are the people upon whom ALLAH bestowed HIS 
      blessings from among the Prophets of the posterity of Adam, and of the 
      posterity of those whom WE carried in the Ark with Noah, and of the 
      posterity of Abraham and Israel; and they are of those whom WE guided and 
      chose. When the Signs of the Gracious God were recited unto them, they 
      fell down, prostrating themselves before ALLAH and weeping. <BR>59. Then 
      there came after them an evil generation who neglected Prayer, and 
      followed their evil desires. So they will meet destruction. <BR>60. Except 
      those who repent and believe and do good deeds. These will enter Heaven 
      and they will not be wronged in the least - <BR>61. Gardens of Eternity, 
      which the Gracious God has promised to HIS servants while they are yet 
      hidden from their sight. Surely, HIS promise must come to pass. <BR>62. 
      They will not hear therein anything vain but only greetings of peace; they 
      will have their sustenance therein, morning and evening. <BR>63. Such is 
      the Heaven which WE shall give for an inheritance to those of OUR servants 
      who are righteous. <BR>64. And the angels will say to them, `We do not 
      come down save by the command of thy Lord. To HIM belongs all that is 
      before us and all that is behind us and all that is between; and thy Lord 
      is not forgetful;'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
