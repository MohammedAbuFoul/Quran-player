    <TD>3. Yet they have taken beside HIM gods, who create nothing but are 
      themselves created, and who have no power to harm or benefit themselves, 
      nor have they any power over death or life or Resurrection. <BR>4. And 
      those who disbelieve say, `It is naught but a lie which he has forged, and 
      other people have helped him with it.' Indeed, they have perpetrated a 
      great injustice and a great falsehood. <BR>5. And they say, `These are 
      fables of the ancient; and he has got them written down and they are read 
      out to him morning and evening.' <BR>6. Say, `HE, Who knows every secret 
      of the heavens and the earth, has revealed it. Verily, HE is the Most 
      Forgiving, Merciful.' <BR>7. And they say, `What sort of Messenger is this 
      that he eats food, and walks in the streets ? Why has not an angel been 
      sent down to him that he might be a warner with him ? <BR>8. `Or a 
      treasure should have been sent down to him, or he should have had a garden 
      to eat therefrom.' And the wrongdoers say, `You follow but a man 
      bewitched.' <BR>9. See how they coin similitudes for thee ! Thus they have 
      gone astray and cannot find a way. <BR>10. Blessed is HE Who, if HE 
      please, will assign to thee better than all that - gardens through which 
      streams flow - and will also assign to thee palaces. <BR>11. Nay, they 
      deny the Hour, and for those who deny the Hour, WE have prepared a blazing 
      fire.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
