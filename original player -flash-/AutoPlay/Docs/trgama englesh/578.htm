    <TD>20. Hearken ! you love the present life; <BR>21. And you neglect the 
      Hereafter. <BR>22. Some faces on that day will be radiant, <BR>23. Looking 
      eagerly towards their Lord; <BR>24. And some faces on that day will be 
      dismal, <BR>25. Knowing that a back-breaking calamity will befall them. 
      <BR>26. Hearken ! when the soul of the dying man comes up to the throat, 
      <BR>27. And it is said, `Who is the Wizard to save him ?' <BR>28. And he 
      is sure that it is the parting; <BR>29. And one shank rubs against the 
      other shank in death-agony; <BR>30. Unto thy Lord that day will be the 
      driving. <BR>31. For, he neither accepted the Truth nor observed Prayer; 
      <BR>32. But he rejected the Truth and turned his back on it; <BR>33. Then 
      he went to kinsfolk, strutting along in pride. <BR>34. `Woe unto thee ! 
      and woe again ! <BR>35. `Then woe unto thee ! and woe again ! <BR>36. Does 
      man think that he is to be left alone without purpose ? <BR>37. Was he not 
      a drop of fluid, emitted forth ? <BR>38. The he became a clot, then ALLAH 
      gave him shape and perfected him. <BR>39. Then HE made of him a pair; the 
      male and female. <BR>40. Has not such a one the power to raise the dead to 
      life ? <BR>&nbsp;

      1. There has, certainly, come upon man a period of time when he was not a 
      thing worth mentioning. <BR>2. WE have created man from a mingled 
      sperm-drop that WE might try him; so WE made him hearing, seeing. <BR>3. 
      WE have shown him the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful. <BR>4. 
      Verily, WE have prepared for the disbelievers chains and iron-collars and 
      blazing Fire. <BR>5. But the virtuous shall drink of a cup, tempered with 
      camphor -&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
