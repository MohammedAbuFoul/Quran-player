    <TD>40. `So we may follow the sorcerers if they are the winners ?' <BR>41. 
      And when the sorcerers came, they said to Pharaoh, `Shall we have a reward 
      if we are the winners ?' <BR>42. He said, `Yes, and surely then you will 
      be among my favourites.' <BR>43. Moses said to them, `Now throw you what 
      you have to throw.' <BR>44. So they threw down their ropes and their rods 
      and said, `By Pharaoh's honour, it is we who will surely win.' <BR>45. 
      Then Moses threw down his rod, and lo ! it swallowed up all that which 
      they had fabricated. <BR>46. Thereupon the sorcerers were impelled to fall 
      down prostrate; <BR>47. They said, `We believe in the Lord of the worlds, 
      <BR>48. `The Lord of Moses and Aaron.' <BR>49. Pharaoh said, `You have 
      believed in him before I gave you leave ? He is surely your chief who has 
      taught you sorcery. But you shall know the consequences thereof. I will 
      most surely cut off your hands and your feet on account of your 
      disobedience and I will most surely crucify you all.' <BR>50. They said, 
      `It can do us no harm; to our Lord shall WE return; <BR>51. `We do hope 
      that our Lord will forgive us our sins, since we are the first among the 
      believers.' <BR>52. And WE revealed to Moses, directing him, `Take away MY 
      servants by night, you will surely be pursued.' <BR>53. And Pharaoh sent 
      summoners into the cities, announcing, <BR>54. `Theses are a small party, 
      <BR>55. `Yet they have offended us; <BR>56. `And we are a multitude fully 
      prepared and vigilant.' <BR>57. So WE turned them out of gardens and 
      springs, <BR>58. And treasures and an abode of honour. <BR>59. Thus it 
      was; and WE gave them as heritage to the children of Israel.&nbsp;<BR>60. 
      And the host of Pharaoh pursued and overtook them at sunrise.
