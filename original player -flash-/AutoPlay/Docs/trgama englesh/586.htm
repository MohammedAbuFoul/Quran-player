    <TD>1. When the sun is folded up, <BR>2. And when the stars are obscured, 
      <BR>3. And when the mountains are made to move, <BR>4. And when the 
      she-camels, ten-month pregnant are abandoned, <BR>5. And when the wild 
      beasts are gathered together, <BR>6. And when the rivers are drained away, 
      <BR>7. And when various people are brought together, <BR>8. And when the 
      female-infant buried alive is questioned about - <BR>9. `For what crime 
      was she killed ?' <BR>10. And when books are spread abroad, <BR>11. And 
      when the heaven is laid bare, <BR>12. And when Hell-Fire is set ablaze, 
      <BR>13. And when Paradise is brought nigh, <BR>14. Then every soul will 
      know what it has produced. <BR>15. Nay ! I call to witness those that 
      recede while advancing, <BR>16. Rush ahead and then hide. <BR>17. And I 
      call to witness the night as it draws to a close, <BR>18. And the dawn as 
      it begins to breathe, <BR>19. That this is, surely, the word revealed to a 
      noble Messenger, <BR>20. Possessor of strength, established in the 
      presence of the Lord of the Throne, <BR>21. Entitled to obedience and 
      faithful to his trust. <BR>22. And your companion is not mad. <BR>23. And 
      he, assuredly, saw him on the clear horizon. <BR>24. And he is not 
      niggardly with respect to the unseen. <BR>25. Nor is this the word of 
      Satan, the rejected. <BR>26. Wither, then, are you going ? <BR>27. It is 
      nothing but a Reminder unto all the worlds, <BR>28. Unto such among you as 
      desire to go straight. <BR>29. And you desire not a thing except that 
      ALLAH, the Lord of the worlds, desire 
it.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
