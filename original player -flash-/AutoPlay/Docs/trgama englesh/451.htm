    <TD>127. But they rejected him, and they will, surely, be brought before 
      God to render an account of their deeds; <BR>128. Except the chosen 
      servants of ALLAH. <BR>129. And WE left for him a good name among the 
      later generations. - <BR>130. Peace be on Elias and his people ! <BR>131. 
      Thus, indeed, do WE reward those who do good. <BR>132. Surely, he was one 
      of Our believing servants. <BR>133. And assuredly, Lot, too, was one of 
      the Messengers, <BR>134. When WE delivered him and all his family, 
      <BR>135. Except an old women who was among those who stayed behind. 
      <BR>136. Then WE utterly destroyed the others. <BR>137. And, surely, you 
      pass by them in the morning, <BR>138. And by night, Will you not 
      understand ? <BR>139. And, surely, Jonah also was one of the Messengers, 
      <BR>140. When he fled to the laden ship; <BR>141. And he cast lots with 
      the crew of the ship and was of the losers. <BR>142. And the fish 
      swallowed him while he was reproaching himself. <BR>143. And had he not 
      been of those who glorify God, <BR>144. He would, surely, have tarried in 
      its belly till the Day of Resurrection. <BR>145. Then WE cast him on a 
      bare tract of land, and he was sick; <BR>146. And WE caused a gourd plant 
      to grow over him. <BR>147. And WE sent him as a Messenger to a hundred 
      thousand people or more, <BR>148. And they all believed; so WE permitted 
      them to enjoy life for a long while. <BR>149. Now ask them whether thy 
      Lord has daughters, whereas they have sons. <BR>150. Did WE create the 
      angels females while they were witnesses ? <BR>151. Now, surely, it is of 
      their fabrications that they say, <BR>152. `ALLAH has begotten children;' 
      and they are certainly liars. <BR>153. Has HE chosen daughters in 
      preference to sons ?&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
