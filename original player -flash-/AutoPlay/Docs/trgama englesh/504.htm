    <TD>15. And WE have enjoined on man to be good to his parents. His mother 
      bears him with pain, and brings him forth with pain, and the bearing of 
      him and his weaning takes thirty months till, when he attains his full 
      maturity and reaches the age of forty years, he says, `My Lord, grant me 
      that I may be grateful for Thy favour which thou hast bestowed upon me and 
      upon my parents, and I may do such righteous deeds as may please Thee. And 
      establish righteousness among my progeny for me. I do turn to thee; and, 
      truly, I am of those who are obedient to thee.' <BR>16. These are they 
      from whom WE accept the best of what they do and overlook their evil 
      deeds. They shall be among the inmates of the Garden, in fulfillment of 
      the true promise which was made to them. <BR>17. But the one who says to 
      his parents, `Fie on you both; do you threaten me that I shall be brought 
      forth again, when generations have already passed away before me ?' And 
      they both cry unto ALLAH for help and say to him. `Woe unto thee ! 
      believe, for the promise of ALLAH is true.' But he says, `This is nothing 
      but the fables of the ancients.' <BR>18. These are they against whom the 
      sentence of punishment was fulfilled along with the communities of the 
      jinn and men that had gone before them. Indeed, they were the losers. 
      <BR>19. And for all are degrees of rank according to what they did, and 
      this will be so that ALLAH may fully repay them for their deeds; and they 
      shall not be wronged. <BR>20. And on the day when those who disbelieve 
      will be brought before the Fire, it will be said to them, `You exhausted 
      your good things in the life of the world, and you fully enjoyed them. Now 
      this day you shall be requited with ignominious punishment because you 
      were arrogant in the earth without justification, and because you acted 
      rebelliously.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
