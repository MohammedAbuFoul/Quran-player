    <TD>58. So he broke them into pieces, all except the chief of them, that 
      they might return to it. <BR>59. They said, `Who has done this to our gods 
      ? Surely, he is a wrongdoer.' <BR>60. Some others said, `We heard a young 
      man speak ill of them; he is called Abraham.' <BR>61. They said, `Then 
      bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may bear witness 
      against him.' <BR>62. Then they said to Abraham, `Is it thou who has done 
      this to our gods, O Abraham ?' <BR>63. He replied, `Well, someone has 
      surely done this. Here is the chief of them. So ask them if they can 
      speak.' <BR>64. Then they turned towards one another and said, `You 
      yourselves are surely in the wrong.' <BR>65. And they were made to hang 
      down their heads for shame and said to Abraham, `Certainly thou knowest 
      well that these do not speak.' <BR>66. He said, `Do you then worship, 
      instead of ALLAH, that which cannot profit you at all, nor harm you ? 
      <BR>67. `Fie on you and on that which you worship instead of ALLAH ! Can 
      you not understand ?' <BR>68. They said, `Burn him and help your gods if 
      at all you mean to do something.' <BR>69. WE said, `O fire, be thou a 
      means of coolness and safety for Abraham !' <BR>70. And they had intended 
      an evil plan against him, but WE made them the worst losers. <BR>71. And 
      WE delivered him and Lot and brought them to the Land which WE had blessed 
      for the peoples. <BR>72. And WE bestowed upon him Isaac, and a grandson, 
      Jacob, and WE made all of them 
righteous.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
