    <TD>146. Those to whom WE have given the Book recognize it even as they 
      recognize their sons, but surely some of them hide the truth knowingly. 
      <BR>147. It is the truth from thy Lord; be not, therefore of those who 
      doubt. <BR>148. And everyone has a goal to which he turns his whole 
      attention. Then vie with one another in good works. Wherever you may be 
      ALLAH will bring you all together. Surely, ALLAH has the power to do all 
      that HE wills. <BR>149. And from wheresoever thou comest forth, turn thy 
      face towards the Sacred Mosque; for that is indeed the truth from thy 
      Lord. And ALLAH is not unmindful of what you do. <BR>150. And from 
      wheresoever thou comest forth, turn thy face towards the Sacred Mosque; 
      and wherever you be, turn your faces towards it that people may have no 
      argument against you, except those who are unjust - so fear them not, but 
      fear ME - and that I may perfect MY favour upon you, and that you may be 
      rightly guided.<BR>151. Even as WE have sent to you a Messenger from among 
      yourselves who recites OUR Signs to you, and purifies you, and teaches you 
      the Book and Wisdom, and teaches you that which you knew not.<BR>152. 
      Therefore, remember ME and I will remember you; and be thankful to ME and 
      do not be ungrateful to ME. <BR>153. O ye who believe, seek help through 
      perseverance and Prayer; surely, ALLAH is with those who patiently 
      persevere.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
