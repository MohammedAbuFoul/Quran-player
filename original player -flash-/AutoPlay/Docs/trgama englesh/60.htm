    <TD>78. And, surely, among them is a party who twist their tongues while 
      reciting the Book that you may think it to be part of the Book, while it 
      is not part of the Book. And they say `It is from ALLAH;' while it is not 
      from ALLAH; and they utter a lie against ALLAH while they know. <BR>79. It 
      does not befit a truthful man that ALLAH should give him the Book and 
      Wisdom and Prophethood, and then he should say to men, `Be my worshippers 
      instead of ALLAH; but he would say, `Be solely devoted to the Lord because 
      you teach the book and because you study it. <BR>80. Nor does it befit 
      that he should bid you to take angels and Prophets for lords. What ! would 
      he enjoin you to disbelieve after you have submitted to God. <BR>81. And 
      remember the time when ALLAH took a covenant from the people through the 
      Prophets, saying `Whatever I give you of the Book and Wisdom and then 
      there comes to you a Messenger, fulfilling that which is with you, you 
      shall believe in him and help him.' And HE said, `Do you agree, and do you 
      accept the responsibility which I lay upon you in this matter ?' They said 
      `We agree.' HE said `Then bear witness and I am with you among the 
      witnesses.' <BR>82. Now whoso turns away after this, then surely, those 
      are the transgressors. <BR>83. Do the seek a religion other than ALLAH's, 
      while to HIM submits whosoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly 
      or unwillingly, and to HIM shall they all be returned
