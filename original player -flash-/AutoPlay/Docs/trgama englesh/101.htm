    <TD>140. And HE has already revealed to you in the Book that when you hear 
      the Signs of God being denied and mocked at, sit not with those who 
      indulge in such talk until they engage in some other talk; for in that 
      case you would be like them. Surely ALLAH will assemble the hypocrite and 
      the disbelievers in Hell, all together. <BR>141. Those who await your 
      ruin. If you have a victory from ALLAH, they say, `Were we not with you ?' 
      And if the disbelievers have a share of it, they say to them, `Did we not 
      on a previous occasion get the better of you and save you from the 
      believers ?' ALLAH will judge between you on the day of Resurrection; and 
      ALLAH will not grant the disbelievers a way to prevail against the 
      believers. <BR>142. The hypocrites seek to deceive ALLAH, but HE will 
      punish them for their deception. And when they stand up for Prayer, they 
      stand up lazily and to be seen of men, and they remember ALLAH but little. 
      <BR>143. Wavering between this and that, belonging neither to these nor to 
      those. And he whom ALLAH causes to perish, for him thou shalt not find a 
      way of escape. <BR>144. O ye who believe, take not disbelievers for 
      friends, in preference to believers. Do you mean to give ALLAH a manifest 
      proof against yourselves ? <BR>145. The hypocrite shall surely be in the 
      lowest depths of the Fire; and thou shalt find no helper for them, 
      <BR>146. Except those who repent and amend and hold fast to ALLAH and are 
      sincere in their obedience to ALLAH - these are among the believers. And 
      ALLAH will soon bestow a great reward upon the believers. <BR>147. Why 
      should ALLAH punish you, if you are thankful and if you believe ? And 
      ALLAH is Appreciating, 
All-Knowing.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
