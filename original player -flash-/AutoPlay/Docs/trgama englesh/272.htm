    <TD>43. And WE sent not as Messengers before thee but men to whom WE sent 
      revelation - so ask those who possess the reminder, if you know not - 
      <BR>44. With clear Signs and Scriptures. And WE have sent down to thee the 
      Reminder that thou mayest explain to mankind that which has been sent down 
      to them, and that they may reflect. <BR>45. Do, then, those who devise 
      evil plans, feel secure that ALLAH will humiliate them in their own land, 
      or that the punishment will not come upon them whence they do not know ? 
      <BR>46. Or that HE will not seize them in their going to and fro so that 
      they shall not be able to frustrate HIS plans ? <BR>47. Or that HE will 
      not destroy them through a process of gradual attrition ? Your Lord is 
      indeed Compassionate, Merciful. <BR>48. Have they not observed, bowing in 
      humility before ALLAH that the shadows of everything which ALLAH has 
      created shift from the right and from the left, and they are being humbled 
      ? <BR>49. And whatever is in the heavens and whatever creature is in the 
      earth submits humbly to ALLAH, and the angels too, and they are not proud. 
      <BR>50. They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are 
      commanded. <BR>51. ALLAH has said, `Take not for worship two gods. There 
      is only One God. So fear ME alone.' <BR>52. And to HIM belongs whatever is 
      in the heavens and the earth and to HIM is obedience due for ever. Will 
      you then take any other than ALLAH as your Protector ? <BR>53. And 
      whatever blessing you have, it is from ALLAH. And when affliction befalls 
      you, it is unto HIM that you cry for help; <BR>54. Then, when HE removes 
      the affliction from you, behold ! a party among you begins to ascribe 
      associates to their Lord,&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
