    <TD>188. Say, `I have no power to do good or harm to myself save as ALLAH 
      please. And if I had the knowledge of the unseen, I should have secured 
      abundance of good; and evil would not have touched me. I am only a Warner 
      and a bearer of good tidings.' <BR>189. HE it is Who created you from a 
      single soul and made therefrom its mate, that he might find comfort in 
      her. And when he knows her, she bears a light burden and goes about with 
      it. And when she grows heavy, they both pray to ALLAH, their Lord, saying, 
      `If thou gives us a good child, we will surely be of the thankful.' 
      <BR>190. But when HE gives them a good child, they associate with HIM 
      partners in respect of that which HE has given them. But exalted is ALLAH 
      far above what they associate with HIM. <BR>191. Do they associate with 
      HIM partners those who create nothing, and are themselves created ? 
      <BR>192. And they give them no help, nor can they help themselves. 
      <BR>193. And if you call them to guidance, they will not follow you. It is 
      the same to you whether you call them or you remain silent. <BR>194. 
      Surely, those whom you call on beside ALLAH are creatures like you. Then 
      call on them and let them answer you, if you are truthful. <BR>195. Have 
      they feet wherewith they walk, or have they hands wherewith they hold, or 
      have they eyes wherewith they see, or have they ears wherewith they hear ? 
      Say, `Call upon the partners you associate with ALLAH, then contrive you 
      all against me and give me no 
respite.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
