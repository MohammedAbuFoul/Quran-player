    <TD>17. There will wait on them youths who will not age, <BR>18. Carrying 
      goblets and ewers and cups filled out of a flowing spring - <BR>19. No 
      headache will they get therefrom, nor will they be intoxicated - <BR>20. 
      And carrying such fruits as they choose, <BR>21. And flesh of birds as 
      they may desire. <BR>22. And there will be fair maidens with wide, lovely 
      eyes, <BR>23. Like pearls well-preserved, <BR>24. As a reward for what 
      they did. <BR>25. They will not hear therein any vain or sinful talk, 
      <BR>26. Except only the word of salutation - `Peace, peace.' <BR>27. Those 
      on the right hand - how lucky are those on the right hand ! - <BR>28. They 
      will be amidst thornless lote-trees, <BR>29. And clustered bananas, 
      <BR>30. And extended shade, <BR>31. And flowing water, <BR>32. And 
      abundant fruit, <BR>33. Neither failing, nor forbidden. <BR>34. And they 
      will have noble spouses. <BR>35. Verily, WE have created them a good 
      creation, <BR>36. And made them virgins, <BR>37. Loving, of equal age; 
      <BR>38. For those on the right hand. <BR>39. A large party from among the 
      first believers. <BR>40. And a large party from among the later ones. 
      <BR>41. And those on the left hand - how unlucky are those on the left 
      hand ! - <BR>42. They will be in the midst of scorching winds and scalding 
      water, <BR>43. And under the shadow of pitch-black smoke; <BR>44. Neither 
      cool nor wholesome. <BR>45. Before this they lived in a life of ease and 
      plenty, <BR>46. And persisted in extreme sinfulness. <BR>47. And they were 
      wont to say, `What ! when we are dead and have become dust and bones, 
      shall we, indeed, be raised again, <BR>48. `And our fathers of yore too ?' 
      <BR>49. Say, `Yes, the earlier ones and the later ones. <BR>50. `Will all 
      be gathered together unto the fixed time of an appointed 
  day.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
