    <TD>87. They prefer to be with the womenfolk, who remain behind at home 
      and their hearts are sealed so that they understand not. <BR>88. But the 
      Messenger and those who believe in him strive in the cause of ALLAH with 
      their wealth and their persons, and it is they who shall have good things, 
      and it is they who shall prosper. <BR>89. ALLAH has prepared for them 
      Gardens under which streams flow; therein shall they abide. That is the 
      supreme triumph. <BR>90. And those, who make excuses from among the desert 
      Arabs, came with the request that exemption might be granted them. And 
      those who lied to ALLAH and HIS Messenger stayed at home. A grievous 
      punishment shall befall those of them who disbelieve. <BR>91. No blame 
      lies on the weak, nor on the sick, nor on those who find naught to spend, 
      if they are sincere to ALLAH and HIS Messenger. There is no cause of 
      reproach against those who do good deeds; and ALLAH is Most Forging, 
      Merciful, <BR>92. Nor against those to whom, when they came to thee that 
      thou shouldst furnish them with mounts thou didst say, `I cannot find 
      whereon I can mount you;' they turned back, their eyes overflowing with 
      tears, out of grief that they could not find what they might spend. 
      <BR>93. The cause of reproach is only against those who ask leave of thee, 
      while they are rich. They are content to be with the womenfolk who remain 
      behind at home. And ALLAH has set a seal upon their hearts so that they 
      know not.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
