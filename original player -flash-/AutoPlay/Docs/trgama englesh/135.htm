    <TD>60. And HE it is who takes your soul by night and knows what you do by 
      day, then HE raises you up again therein, that the appointed term may be 
      completed. Then to HIM is your return. Then will HE inform you of what you 
      used to do. <BR>61. And HE is Supreme over HIS servants, and HE sends 
      guardians to watch over you, until, when death comes to anyone of you, OUR 
      Messengers take his soul, and they fail not. <BR>62. Then they are 
      returned to ALLAH, their true Lord. Surely, HIS is the judgment. And HE is 
      the Swiftest of reckoners. <BR>63. Say, `Who delivers you from the 
      calamities of the land and the sea, when you call upon HIM in humility and 
      in secret, saying, `If HE deliver us from this, we will surely be of those 
      who are grateful.' <BR>64. Say, `ALLAH delivers you from them and from 
      every distress, yet you associate partners with HIM.' <BR>65. Say, `HE has 
      the power to send punishment upon you from above you or from beneath your 
      feet, or to confound you by splitting you into sects and make you taste 
      the violence of one another. See how WE expound the Signs in various ways 
      that they may understand ! <BR>66. And thy people have rejected it though 
      it is the truth. Say, `I am not a guardian over you.' <BR>67. For every 
      prophecy there is a fixed time; and soon will you come to know. <BR>68. 
      And when thou seest those who engage in vain discourse concerning OUR 
      Signs, then turn thou away from them until they engage in a discourse 
      other than that. And if Satan should cause thee to forget, then sit not, 
      after recollection, with the unjust 
people.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
