    <TD>48. So the intercession of intercessors will not avail them. <BR>49. 
      Now what is the matter with them that they are turning away from the 
      Exhortation, <BR>50. As if they were frightened asses, <BR>51. Fleeing 
      from a lion ? <BR>52. Nay, every man among them desires to be given an 
      open Book. <BR>53. This cannot be ! Verily, they fear not the Hereafter. 
      <BR>54. Never ! for, this Qur'an is an exhortation enough. <BR>55. Let 
      him, then, who will, remember it. <BR>56. And they will not remember 
      unless ALLAH so pleases. HE alone is worthy to be feared and HE alone is 
      worthy to forgive. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. Nay, I swear by the Day of Resurrection. <BR>2. Nay, I swear by the 
      self accusing soul, that the Day of Judgment is a certainty. <BR>3. Does 
      man think that WE shall not assemble his bones ? <BR>4. Yea, WE have the 
      power to restore his very finger-tips. <BR>5. But man desires to continue 
      to send forth evil deeds in front of him. <BR>6. He inquires `When will be 
      the Day of Resurrection ?' <BR>7. When the eye is dazzled, <BR>8. And the 
      moon is eclipsed, <BR>9. And the sun and the moon are brought together, 
      <BR>10. On that day man will say, `Wither to flee ?' <BR>11. Not at all; 
      there is no refuge ! <BR>12. With thy Lord alone will be the place of rest 
      that day. <BR>13. On that day will man be informed of that which he has 
      sent forward and of that which he has left behind. <BR>14. In truth man is 
      a witness against himself, <BR>15. Even though he puts forward his 
      excuses. <BR>16. Move not thy tongue, O Prophet, with the revelation of 
      the Qur'an that thou mayest hasten to preserve it. <BR>17. Surely, upon US 
      rests its collection and its recital. <BR>18. So when WE recite it, then 
      follow thou its recital. <BR>19. Then upon US rests the expounding 
      thereof.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
