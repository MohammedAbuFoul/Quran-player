    <TD>77. And WE directed Moses by revelation: `Take away MY servants by 
      night, and strike for them a dry path through the sea, fearing not to be 
      overtaken, nor having any other fear.' <BR>78. Then Pharaoh pursued them 
      with his hosts, and the waters of the sea completely covered them. <BR>79. 
      And Pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide them aright. <BR>80. O 
      Children of Israel, WE delivered you from your enemy, and WE made a 
      covenant with you on the right side of the Mount, and sent down on you 
      Manna and Salwa. <BR>81. And admonished you, `Eat of the good things that 
      WE have provided for you, and transgress not therein, lest MY wrath 
      descend upon you; and he, on whom MY wrath descends, shall perish; <BR>82. 
      `But, surely, I am All-Forgiving to him who repents and believes and does 
      righteous deeds, then sticks to guidance.' <BR>83. When Moses arrived for 
      his tryst with his Lord HE said, `And what has made thee hasten away from 
      thy people, O Moses ?' <BR>84. He said, `They are closely following in my 
      footsteps and I have hastened to Thee, my Lord, that Thou mightest be 
      pleased.' <BR>85. God said, `WE have tried thy people in thy absence, and 
      the Samiry has led them astray.' <BR>86. So Moses returned to his people, 
      angry and sad, and he said, `O my people, did not your Lord promise you a 
      gracious promise ? Did, then, the time of its fulfillment appear too long 
      to you, or did you desire that wrath should descend upon you from your 
      Lord, that you broke your promise to me ?' <BR>87. They said, `We did not 
      break our promise to thee of our own accord; but we were laden with loads 
      of people's ornaments and we cast them away, and likewise did the Samiry 
      cast away.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
