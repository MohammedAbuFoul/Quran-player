    <TD>135. O ye who believe ! be strict in observing justice and be 
      witnesses for ALLAH, even though it be against yourselves or against your 
      parents or kindred. Whether he, against whom witness is borne, be rich or 
      poor, ALLAH is more regardful of them both than you are. Therefore follow 
      not your low desires that you may be able to act equitably. And if you 
      hide the truth or evade it, then know that ALLAH is Well-Aware of what you 
      do. <BR>136. O ye who believe ! believe in ALLAH and HIS Messenger and in 
      the Book which HE had revealed to HIS Messenger, and the Book which HE 
      revealed before it. And whoso disbelieves in ALLAH and HIS angels, and HIS 
      Books and HIS Messengers and the Last Day, has surely strayed far away. 
      <BR>137. Those who believe, then disbelieve, then again believe, then 
      disbelieve and then increase in disbelief, ALLAH will never forgive them 
      nor will HE guide them to the right way. <BR>138. Give to the hypocrites 
      the tidings that for them is a grievous punishment; <BR>139. Those who 
      take disbelievers as friends rather than believers. Do they seek honour at 
      their hands ? Surely, all honour belongs to ALLAH. <BR>140. And HE has 
      already revealed to you in the Book that when you hear the Signs of God 
      being denied and mocked at, sit not with those who indulge in such talk 
      until they engage in some other talk; for in that case you would be like 
      them. Surely ALLAH will assemble the hypocrite and the disbelievers in 
      Hell, all together.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
