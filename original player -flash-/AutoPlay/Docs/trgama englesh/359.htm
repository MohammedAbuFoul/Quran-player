    <TD>62. Those alone are true believers who believe in ALLAH and HIS 
      Messenger and who, when they are with him for the consideration of some 
      matter of common concern which has brought them together, go not away 
      until they have asked leave of him. Surely, those who ask leave of thee, 
      it is they alone who truly believe in ALLAH and HIS Messenger. So, when 
      they ask leave of thee for some urgent affair of theirs, give leave to 
      those of them whom thou pleasest and ask forgiveness for them of ALLAH. 
      Surely, ALLAH is Most forgiving, Merciful. <BR>63. Treat not the calling 
      of the Messenger among you like the calling of one of you to another. 
      ALLAH indeed knows those of you who steal away covertly. So let those who 
      go against HIS command beware lest a trial afflict them or a grievous 
      punishment overtake them. <BR>64. Hearken ! To ALLAH belongs whatsoever is 
      in the heavens and the earth. HE knows in what condition you are. And on 
      the day when they will be returned unto HIM, HE will inform them of what 
      they did. And ALLAH knows everything full well. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. Blessed is HE who has sent down Al-Furqan to HIS servant, that he may 
      be a Warner to all the worlds - <BR>2. HE to Whom belongs the Kingdom of 
      the heavens and the earth. And HE has taken unto Himself no son, and has 
      no partner in the Kingdom, and HE has created everything, and has 
      determined its proper 
measure.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
