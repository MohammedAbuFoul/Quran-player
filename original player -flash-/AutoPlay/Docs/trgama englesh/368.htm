    <TD>20. Moses said, `I did it then inadvertently, and I was in a perplexed 
      state of mind; <BR>21. `So I fled from you when I feared you; then my Lord 
      granted me right judgment and made me one of the Messengers. <BR>22. `And 
      this favour of bringing me up as a child with which thou now tauntest me, 
      dost thou put forward against thy having enslaved the Children of Israel 
      ?' <BR>23. Pharaoh said, `And what is the Lord of the worlds ?' <BR>24. 
      Moses said, `The Lord of the heavens and the earth and of all that is 
      between the two, if you would believe.' <BR>25. Pharaoh said to those 
      around him, `Do you not hear ?' <BR>26. Moses said, `Your Lord and the

      visible. <BR>33. And he drew out his hand, and lo ! it was white for the 
      beholders. <BR>34. Pharaoh said to the chiefs around him, `This is surely 
      a skillful sorcerer; <BR>35. `He seeks to turn you out of your land by his 
      sorcery. Now, what do you advise ?' <BR>36. They said, `Put him off and 
      his brother awhile and send into the cities summoners, <BR>37. `Who should 
      bring thee every skillful and cunning sorcerer.' <BR>38. So the sorcerers
