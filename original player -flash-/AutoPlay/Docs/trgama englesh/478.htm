    <TD>12. So HE completed them in the form of seven heavens in two days, and 
      HE revealed to each heaven its function. And WE adorned the lowest heaven 
      with lamps for light and provided it with the means of protection. That is 
      the decree of the Mighty, the All-Knowing. <BR>13. But if they turn away, 
      then say, `I warn you of a destructive punishment like the punishment 
      which overtook Ad and Thamud.' <BR>14. When their Messengers came to them 
      before them and from behind them, admonishing them, `Worship none but 
      ALLAH,' they said, `If our Lord had so willed, HE would, certainly, have 
      sent down angels. So we do disbelieve in that with which you have been 
      sent.' <BR>15. As for Ad, they behaved arrogantly in the earth without 
      justification and said, `Who is mightier than we in power ?' Do they not 
      see that ALLAH, Who created them, is mightier than they in power ? Still 
      they continued to deny Our Signs. <BR>16. So WE sent upon them a furious 
      wind for several ominous days, that WE might make them taste the 
      punishment of humiliation in this life. And the punishment of the 
      Hereafter will, surely, be more humiliating, and they will not be helped. 
      <BR>17. And as for Thamud, WE guided them, but they preferred blindness to 
      guidance, so the calamity of a humiliating punishment seized them, on 
      account of what they had earned. <BR>18. And WE saved those who believed 
      and acted righteously. <BR>19. And warn them of the day when the enemies 
      of ALLAH will be gathered together and driven to the Fire, and they will 
      be divided into groups; <BR>20. Till when they reach it, their ears and 
      their eyes and their skins will bear witness against them as to what they 
      had been doing.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
