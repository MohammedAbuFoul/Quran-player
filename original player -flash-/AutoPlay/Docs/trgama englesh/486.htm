    <TD>23. This it is whereof ALLAH gives the glad tidings to HIS servants 
      who believe and do good works. Say, `I ask of you no reward for my service 
      to you, except such love as subsist between kindred. And whoso earns a 
      good deed, WE give him increase of good therein. Surely, ALLAH is Most 
      Forgiving, Most Appreciating. <BR>24. Do they say, `He has forged a lie 
      against ALLAH ?' If ALLAH had so willed, HE could seal thy heart. But 
      ALLAH blots out falsehood through thee and establishes the truth by HIS 
      words. Surely, HE knows quite well what is in the breasts. <BR>25. And HE 
      it is Who accepts repentance from HIS servants and forgives sins. And HE 
      knows what you do. <BR>26. And HE accepts the prayers of those who believe 
      and do good works, and gives them more than their due reward, out of HIS 
      grace; and the disbelievers will have a severe punishment. <BR>27. And if 
      ALLAH should greatly enlarge the provision for HIS servants, they would 
      rebel in the earth; but HE sends down according to a proper measure as HE 
      pleases. Indeed, HE is All-Aware and All-Seeing of the condition of His 
      servants. <BR>28. And HE it is Who sends down rain after they have 
      despaired of it and spreads out his mercy. And HE is the Protector, the 
      Praiseworthy. <BR>29. And among HIS signs is the creation of the Heavens 
      and the earth, and of whatever living creatures HE has spread forth in 
      both. And HE has the power to gather them together whenever HE pleases. 
      <BR>30. And whatever misfortune befalls you is the consequence of what 
      your own hands have wrought. And HE forgives many of your sins. <BR>31. 
      And you cannot frustrate God's purpose in the earth, nor have you any 
      friend or helper beside 
ALLAH.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
