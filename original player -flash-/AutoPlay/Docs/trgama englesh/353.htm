    <TD>28. And if you find no one therein, do not enter them until you are 
      given permission. And if it be said to you, `Go Back,' then go back; that 
      is purer for you. And ALLAH knows well what you do. <BR>29. It is not 
      wrong on your part to enter uninhabited houses wherein are your goods. And 
      ALLAH knows what you do openly and what you hide. <BR>30. Say to the 
      believing men that they restrain their looks and guard their private 
      parts. That is purer for them. Surely, ALLAH is Well-Aware of what they 
      do. <BR>31. And say to the believing women that they restrain their looks 
      and guard their private parts, and that they display not their beauty or 
      their embellishment except that which is apparent thereof, and that they 
      draw their head-coverings over their bosoms, and that they display not 
      their beauty or their embellishment save to their husbands, or to their 
      fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or their sons, or the sons of 
      their husbands, or their brothers or the sons of their brothers, or the 
      sons of their sisters, or women who are their companions, or those that 
      their right hands possess, or such of male attendants as have no desire 
      for women, or young children who have not yet attained knowledge of the 
      hidden parts of women. And that they strike not their feet so that what 
      they hide of their ornaments may become known. And turn ye to ALLAH all 
      together, O believers, that you may 
prosper.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
