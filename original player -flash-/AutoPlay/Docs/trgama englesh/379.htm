    <TD>23. `I found a woman ruling over them, and she has been given every 
      necessary thing and she has a mighty throne; <BR>24. `I found her and her 
      people worshiping the sun instead of ALLAH, and Satan has made their works 
      look beautiful to them, and has thus hindered them from the right way, so 
      they are not rightly guided - <BR>25. `And they insist that they will not 
      worship ALLAH, while ALLAH is HE who brings to light that which is hidden 
      in the heavens and the earth, And Who knows what you conceal and what you 
      disclose of your design; <BR>26. `ALLAH ! there is no god but HE, the Lord 
      of the Mighty Throne.' <BR>27. Thereupon Solomon said, `We shall see 
      whether thou hast spoken the truth or whether thou art a liar; <BR>28. `Go 
      thou, with this letter of mine, and lay it before them; then withdraw from 
      them and see what answer they return.' <BR>29. The Queen said, `Ye chiefs, 
      there has been delivered to me a noble letter; <BR>30. `It is from 
      Solomon, and it is `In the name of ALLAH, the Gracious, the Merciful; 
      <BR>31. `Behave not arrogantly towards me, but come to me in submission.' 
      <BR>32. She said, `Ye chiefs, advise me concerning my affair. I never 
      decide any affair until you are present to advise me.' <BR>33. They 
      replied, `We possess power and we possess great prowess in war, but it is 
      for thee to command; so consider what thou wilt command.' <BR>34. She 
      said, `Surely, the kings, when they enter a country, despoil it, and turn 
      the highest of its people into the lowest. And thus they always do; 
      <BR>35. `But I am going to send them a present and wait to see what answer 
      the envoys bring back.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
