    <TD>111. On the day when every soul shall come pleading for itself, and 
      every soul will be fully recompensed for what it did, and they will not be 
      wronged. <BR>112. And ALLAH sets forth the parable of a city which enjoyed 
      security and peace; its provisions come to it in plenty from every 
      quarter; but it was ungrateful for the favours of ALLAH, so ALLAH made it 
      taste hunger and fear which clothed it like a garment because of what they 
      used do. <BR>113. And indeed there has come to them a Messenger from among 
      themselves, but they treated him as a liar, so punishment overtook them 
      while they were wrongdoers. <BR>114. So eat of the lawful and good things 
      which ALLAH has provided for you; and be grateful for the bounty of ALLAH, 
      if it is HIM you worship. <BR>115. HE has made unlawful for you only that 
      which dies of itself and blood and the flesh of swine and that on which 
      the name of other than ALLAH has been invoked. But he who is driven by 
      necessity to eat any of these things, being neither disobedient nor 
      exceeding the limit, them, surely, ALLAH is Most Forgiving, Merciful. 
      <BR>116. And say not - because of the falsehood which your tongues utter - 
      `This is lawful, and this is unlawful,' so as to be of those who forge 
      lies against ALLAH. Surely, those who forge lies against ALLAH do not 
      prosper. <BR>117. This life is a brief enjoyment and then they shall have 
      a grievous punishment. <BR>118. And to those also who are the Jews, WE 
      forbade before this all that WE have related to thee. And WE wronged them 
      not, but they used to wrong 
themselves.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
