    <TD>15. There was, indeed, a Sign for Saba in their homeland -two gardens, 
      one on the right hand and one on the left; and WE said to them, `Eat of 
      the provision of your Lord and give thanks to HIM. Your town is a 
      beautiful town and your Lord Most Forgiving' <BR>16. But they turned away; 
      so WE sent against them a devastating flood. And WE gave them, in place of 
      their two excellent gardens, two gardens bearing bitter fruit and 
      containing tamarisk and a few lote-trees. <BR>17. Thus WE requited them 
      because of their ingratitude; and it is only the ungrateful that WE 
      requite in this manner. <BR>18. And WE placed, between them and the towns 
      which WE had blessed, other towns that were prominently visible, and WE 
      fixed easy stages between them and said: `Travel in them by night and day 
      in security.' <BR>19. But instead of giving thanks to God, they said, `Our 
      Lord, place longer distances between the stages of our journeys.' And they 
      wronged themselves; so WE made them bywords and WE broke them into pieces, 
      an utter breaking up. In that, verily, are Signs for every steadfast and 
      grateful person. <BR>20. And Iblis, indeed, found true his judgment 
      concerning them, so they followed him, all except a party of true 
      believers. <BR>21. And he had no power over them, but it was so that WE 
      might distinguish those who believed in the Hereafter from those who were 
      in doubt about it. And thy Lord is watchful over all things. <BR>22. Say, 
      `Call upon those whom you assert to be gods beside ALLAH. They control not 
      even the weight of an atom in the heavens or in the earth, nor have they 
      any share in either, nor has HE any helper among 
them.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
