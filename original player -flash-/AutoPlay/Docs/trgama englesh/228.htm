    <TD>54. `We can only say that some of our gods have smitten thee with 
      evil.' He replied, `Surely, I call ALLAH to witness, and do ye also bear 
      witness that I am clear of the sin of your associating <BR>55. `Other gods 
      with HIM. So devise plans against me, all of you, and give me no respite; 
      <BR>56. `I have indeed put my trust in ALLAH, my Lord and your Lord. There 
      is no creature that moves on the earth but HE holds it by the forelock. 
      Surely, my Lord is on the straight path to help those who put their trust 
      in HIM; <BR>57. `If, then, you turn away, I have already conveyed to you 
      that with which I have been sent to you, and my Lord will make another 
      people to take your place, and you cannot harm HIM at all. Surely, my Lord 
      is Guardian over all things.' <BR>58. And when our command came, WE saved 
      Hud and those who believed with him, by OUR special mercy. And WE save 
      them from a severe torment. <BR>59. And such was `Ad. They denied the 
      Signs of their Lord and disobeyed HIS Messengers and followed the bidding 
      of every haughty enemy of truth. <BR>60. And they were pursued by a curse 
      in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection. Behold ! the `Ad were 
      ungrateful to their Lord. Behold ! destruction is decreed for `Ad, the 
      people of Hud. <BR>61. And to the tribe of Thamud, WE sent their brother 
      Salih. He said, `O my people, worship ALLAH; you have no god other than 
      HIM. HE raised you up from the earth and settled you therein. So ask 
      forgiveness of HIM, then turn to HIM wholly. Verily, my Lord is nigh, and 
      answers prayers.' <BR>62. They said, `O Salih, thou wast among us one whom 
      we placed our hopes. Dost thou forbid us to worship what our fathers 
      worshiped ? And we are surely in disquieting doubt concerning that to 
      which thou callest us.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
