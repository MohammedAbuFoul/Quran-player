    <TD>76. And indeed they are near to scare thee to drive thee away from the 
      land that they might expel thee therefrom, but in that case they 
      themselves would not have stayed after thee save a little. <BR>77. This 
      has been OUR way with OUR Messengers whom WE sent before thee; and thou 
      wilt not find any change in OUR way. <BR>78. Observe Prayer from the 
      declining and paling of the sun till the darkness of the night, and recite 
      the Qur'an at dawn. Verily, the recitation of the Qur'an at dawn is 
      specially acceptable to ALLAH. <BR>79. And during a part of the night wake 
      up for its recitation - a supererogatory service for thee. It may be that 
      thy Lord will raise thee to an exalted station. <BR>80. And say, `O my 
      Lord, make my entry a good entry and make me go forth a good going forth. 
      And grant me from thyself a helping power.' <BR>81. And proclaim: `Truth 
      has come and falsehood has vanished. Verily, falsehood is bound to vanish. 
      <BR>82. And WE gradually reveal of the Qur'an that which is healing and a 
      mercy to believers; but it only adds to the loss of the wrongdoers. 
      <BR>83. And when WE bestow favour on man, he turns away and goes aside; 
      and when evil touches him, he gives himself up to despair. <BR>84. Say, 
      `Everyone acts according to his own way, and your Lord knows well who is 
      best guided.' <BR>85. And they ask thee concerning the soul. Say, `The 
      soul has been created by the command of my Lord; and of the knowledge 
      thereof you have been given but a little. <BR>86. And if WE pleased, WE 
      could certainly take away that which WE have revealed to thee and then 
      thou wouldst find no guardian for thyself against US in the 
  matter&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
