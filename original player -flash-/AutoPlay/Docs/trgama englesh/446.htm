    <TD>1. By those who range themselves in close ranks, <BR>2. And those who 
      repel evil vigorously, <BR>3. And those who recite the Reminder - the 
      Qur'an, <BR>4. Surely, your God is One, <BR>5. Lord of the heavens and the 
      earth and all that is between them and the Lord of the places from which 
      light spreads forth. <BR>6. WE have adorned the lowest heaven with an 
      adornment - the planets; <BR>7. And have guarded it against all rebellious 
      satans. <BR>8. They cannot listen to anything from the Exalted Assembly of 
      angels - and they are pelted from every side, <BR>9. Repulsed, and for 
      them is a perpetual punishment <BR>10. But if any of them snatches away 
      something by stealth, he is pursued by a piecing flame. <BR>11. So ask 
      them whether it is they who are harder to create, or those others whom WE 
      have created ? Them WE have created of cohesive clay. <BR>12. Nay, thou 
      dost wonder at what they say, and they ridicule what thou sayest. <BR>13. 
      And when they are admonished, they pay no heed. <BR>14. And when they see 
      a Sign, they mock at it. <BR>15. And they say, this is nothing but plain 
      sorcery, <BR>16. `What ! when we are dead and have become dust and broken 
      bones, shall we then be raised up again ? <BR>17. `And our fathers of yore 
      also ?' <BR>18. Say, `Yea; and you will, then, be abased.' <BR>19. It will 
      be but one stern call, and lo ! they will be up and seeing; <BR>20. And 
      they will say, `Alas for us ! this is the Day of Requital.' <BR>21. ALLAH 
      will say, `This is the day of the final Decision which you used to deny.' 
      <BR>22. The angels will be commanded: `Assemble those who acted wrongfully 
      along with their companions and what they used to worship <BR>23. `Beside 
      ALLAH; and lead them along the path of Hell. <BR>24. `And stop them, for 
      they shall be 
questioned.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
