    <TD>160. And WE divided them into twelve tribes, distinct peoples. And, WE 
      revealed to Moses, when his people asked him for water, saying, `Strick 
      the rock with thy rod;' and from it there gushed forth twelve springs; 
      every tribe knew their drinking place. And WE caused the clouds to 
      overshadow them and WE sent down for them Manna and Salwa and WE said, 
      `Eat of the good things WE have provided for you.' And they wronged US 
      not, but it was themselves that they wronged. <BR>161. And remember the 
      time when it was said to them, `Dwell in this town and eat therefrom 
      wherever you will, and say, `God ! lighten our burden,' and enter the gate 
      in humility, WE shall forgive you your sins, and surely WE shall give 
      increase to those who do good.' <BR>162. But the transgressors among them 
      changed it for a word other than that which was said to them. So WE sent 
      upon them a punishment from heaven, because of their wrongdoing. <BR>163. 
      And ask them concerning the town which stood by the sea. When they 
      profaned the Sabbath; when their fish came to them on their Sabbath day 
      appearing on the surface of the water, but on the day when they did not 
      keep the Sabbath, they came not to them. Thus did WE try them because they 
      were rebellious.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
