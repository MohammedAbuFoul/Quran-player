    <TD>89. Whoever does a good deed shall have a better reward than that, and 
      such will be secure from terror that day. <BR>90. And those who do evil, 
      shall be thrown down on their faces into the Fire; and it will be said to 
      them, `Are you not rewarded for what you have been doing ?' <BR>91. Say, 
      `I am commanded only to serve the Lord of this City which HE has made 
      sacred, and to HIM belongs all things; and I am commanded to be of those 
      who submit to God, <BR>92. `And to recite the Qur'an. So whoever follows 
      guidance follows it only for the good of his own soul; and as to him who 
      goes astray, say, `I am only a Warner.' <BR>93. And say, `All praise 
      belongs to ALLAH; HE will soon show you HIS Signs, and you will know 
      them.' And thy Lord is not unaware of what you do. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. Ta Sin Mim. <BR>2. These are verses of the perspicuous Book. <BR>3. We 
      rehearse unto thee a true account of Moses and Pharaoh for the benefit of 
      a people who would believe. <BR>4. Verily, Pharaoh behaved arrogantly in 
      the earth, and divided the people thereof into sections; he sought to 
      weaken one section of them, slaughtering their sons and sparing their 
      women. Certainly, he was one of the mischief-makers. <BR>5. And WE desired 
      to show favour unto those who were considered weak in the earth, and to 
      make them leaders and to make them inheritors of Our 
  favours,&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
