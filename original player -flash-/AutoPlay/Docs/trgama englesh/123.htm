    <TD>90. O ye who believe ! wine and the game of chance and idols and 
      divining arrows are only the abomination of Satan's handiwork. So shun 
      each one of them that you may prosper. <BR>91. Satan seeks only to create 
      enmity and hatred among you by means of wine and the game of chance, and 
      to keep you back from the remembrance of ALLAH and from Prayer. Then will 
      you keep back ? <BR>92. And obey ALLAH and obey the Messenger, and be on 
      your guard. but if you turn away, then know that on Our Messenger lies 
      only the clear conveyance of the Message. <BR>93. On those who believe and 
      do good works there shall be no sin for what they eat, provided they fear 
      ALLAH and believe and do good works, and again fear ALLAH and believe, yet 
      again fear ALLAH and do good. And ALLAH loves those who do good. <BR>94. O 
      ye who believe ! ALLAH will surely try you in a little matter: the game 
      which your hands and lances can reach, so that ALLAH may cause to be known 
      those who fear HIM in secret. Whoso, therefore, will transgress after 
      this, shall have a grievous punishment. <BR>95. O ye who believe ! kill 
      not game while you are in a state of Pilgrimage. And whoso among you kills 
      it intentionally, its compensation is a quadruped like unto that which he 
      has killed, as determined by two just men from among you, the same to be 
      bought as an offering to the Ka'bah; or as an expiation he shall feed a 
      number of poor persons, or fast an equivalent number of days, so that he 
      may taste the penalty of his deed. As for the past, ALLAH forgives it; but 
      whoso reverts to it, ALLAH will punish him for his offence. And ALLAH is 
      the Lord of retribution.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
