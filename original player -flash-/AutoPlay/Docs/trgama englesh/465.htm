    <TD>57. Or, lest it should say, `If ALLAH had guided me, I should 
      certainly have been among those who fully carry out their duties; <BR>58. 
      Or, lest it should say, when it sees the punishment, `Would that there 
      were for me a return to the world, I would then be among those who do 
      good.' <BR>59. He will be told, `Aye, there came to thee MY Signs, but 
      thou didst treat them as lies, and thou wast arrogant, and thou wast of 
      the disbelievers.' <BR>60. And on the Day of Resurrection, thou wilt see 
      those who lied against ALLAH that their faces shall be overcast with 
      gloom. Is there not in Hell an abode for the proud ? <BR>61. And ALLAH 
      will deliver the righteous from all troubles and will confer success upon 
      them; evil shall not touch them, nor shall they grieve. <BR>62. ALLAH is 
      the creator of all things, and HE is Guardian over all things. <BR>63. TO 
      HIM belong the keys of the heavens and the earth; and as for those who 
      disbelieve in the Signs of ALLAH, these it is who are the losers. <BR>64. 
      Say, `Is it other gods than ALLAH that ye bid me worship, O ignorant ones 
      ?' <BR>65. And, verily it has been revealed to thee as unto those before 
      thee, `If thou associate partners with ALLAH, thy work shall, surely, come 
      to naught and thou shalt certainly be of the losers.' <BR>66. Aye, worship 
      ALLAH and be thou among the grateful. <BR>67. And they have not formed a 
      true concept of the attributes of ALLAH. And the entire earth will be 
      under HIS complete control on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens 
      rolled up in HIS right hand. Glory be to HIM and exalted is HE above that 
      which they associate with 
HIM.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
