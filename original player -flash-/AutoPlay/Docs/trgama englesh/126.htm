    <TD>109. Think of the day when ALLAH will assemble the Messengers and say, 
      `What was the reply made to you ?' They will say, `We have no knowledge, 
      it is only Thou Who art the Knower of hidden things. <BR>110. When ALLAH 
      will say, `O Jesus son of Mary, remember MY favour upon thee and upon thy 
      mother; When I strengthened thee with the spirit of holiness so that thou 
      didst speak to the people in the cradle and when of middle age; and when I 
      taught thee the Book and the wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and when 
      thou didst fashion a creation out of clay, in the likeness of a bird, by 
      MY command; then thou didst breathe into it a new spirit and it became a 
      soaring being by MY command; and thou didst heal the night-blind and the 
      leprous by MY command; and when thou didst raise the dead by MY command; 
      and when I restrained the Children of Israel from putting thee to death 
      when thou didst come to them with clear Signs; and those who disbelieved 
      from among them said, `This is nothing but clear deception.' <BR>111. And 
      remember MY favour when I inspired the disciples saying, `Believe in ME 
      and MY Messenger,' they said, `We believe and bear Thou witness that we 
      have submitted.' <BR>112. When the disciples said, `O Jesus, son of Mary, 
      is thy Lord able to send down to us a table spread with food from heaven ? 
      He said, `Fear ALLAH, if you are believers.' <BR>113. They said, `We 
      desire that we may eat of it, and that our hearts may be at rest and that 
      we may know that thou hast spoken the truth to us, and that we may be 
      witness thereto.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
