    <TD>101. How would you disbelieve, while to you are rehearsed the Signs of 
      ALLAH, and HIS messenger is in your midst ? And he who holds fast to ALLAH 
      is indeed guided to the right path. <BR>102. O ye who believe ! fear ALLAH 
      as HE should be feared; and let not death overtake you except when you are 
      in a state of submission. <BR>103. And hold fast, all together, to the 
      rope of ALLAH and be not divided; and remember the favour of ALLAH which 
      HE bestowed upon you when you were enemies and HE united your hearts in 
      love, so that by HIS grace you became as brothers; and you were on the 
      brink of a pit of fire and HE saved you from it. Thus does ALLAH explain 
      to you HIS commandments that you may be guided. <BR>104. And let there 
      always be among you a body of men who should invite to goodness, and 
      enjoin virtue and forbid evil. And it is they who shall prosper. <BR>105. 
      And be not like those who became divided and who disagreed among 
      themselves after clear proofs had come to them. And it is they for whom 
      there shall be grievous punishment, <BR>106. On the day when some faces 
      shall be white, and some faces shall be black. As for those whose faces 
      will be black, it will be said to them: `Did you disbelieve after 
      believing ? Taste then the punishment because you disbelieved.' <BR>107. 
      And as for those whose faces will be white, they will be in the mercy of 
      ALLAH; therein will they abide. <BR>108. These are the Signs of ALLAH, 
      comprising the Truth. WE rehearse them to thee and ALLAH desires not any 
      injustice to HIS creatures. &nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
