    <TD>179. Verily, WE have created many of the jinn and the men whose end 
      shall be Hell. They have hearts wherewith they understand not and they 
      have eyes wherewith they see not and they have ears wherewith they hear 
      not. They are like cattle; nay, they are even more astray. They are indeed 
      altogether heedless. <BR>180. And to ALLAH alone belong all perfect 
      attributes. So call on HIM by these attributes. And leave alone those who 
      deviate from the right way with respect to HIS attributes. They shall be 
      requited for what they do. <BR>181. And of those WE have created, there 
      are a people that guide men with truth and do justice therewith. <BR>182. 
      And those who reject Our Signs, WE will draw them towards destruction step 
      by step in a manner which they do not know. <BR>183. And I give them 
      respite, surely MY plan is mighty. <BR>184. Do they not consider that 
      there is nothing of insanity about their companion ? He is only a plain 
      warner. <BR>185. And do they not look into the Kingdom of the heavens and 
      the earth and all things that ALLAH has created ? And do they not see 
      that, it may be, their own term has already drawn near ? Then in what 
      thing after this will they believe ? <BR>186. Whomsoever ALLAH adjudges 
      astray, there can be no guide for him. And HE leave such in their 
      transgression, wandering in distraction. <BR>187. They ask thee about the 
      Hour; `When it will come to pass ?' Say, `The knowledge thereof is only 
      with my Lord. None can manifest it at its time but HE. It lies heavy on 
      the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you but of a sudden.' 
      They ask thee as if thou were well-acquainted therewith. Say, `The 
      knowledge thereof is only with ALLAH; but most men do not 
  know.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
