    <TD>37. Men, whom neither merchandise nor traffic diverts from the 
      remembrance of ALLAH and the observance of Prayer, and the giving of 
      Zak?t. They fear a day in which hearts and eyes will be in a state of 
      agitation and anguish; <BR>38. So ALLAH will give them the best reward of 
      their deeds, and give them increase out of HIS bounty. And ALLAH does 
      provide for whomsoever HE pleases without measure. <BR>39. And as to those 
      who disbelieve, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one 
      imagines it to be water until, when he comes up to it, he finds it to be 
      nothing. And he finds ALLAH near him, WHO then pays him his account in 
      full; And ALLAH is swift in reckoning. <BR>40. Or, their deeds are like 
      thick layers of darkness spread over a vast and deep sea, on whose surface 
      rise waves above waves, above which are clouds - layers upon layers of 
      darkness. When he holds out his hands, he can hardly see it; and he whom 
      ALLAH gives no light - for him there is no light at all. <BR>41. Seest 
      thou not that it is ALLAH Whose praises, all who are in the heavens and 
      the earth celebrate, and so do the birds with their wings outspread ? Each 
      one knows his own mode of prayer and praise. And ALLAH knows well what 
      they do. <BR>42. And to ALLAH belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the 
      earth, and to ALLAH shall be the return. <BR>43. Seest thou not that ALLAH 
      drives the clouds slowly, then joins them together, then piles them up so 
      that thou seest rain issue forth from the midst thereof ? And HE sends 
      down from the sky clouds like mountains wherein is hail, and HE smites 
      therewith whom HE pleases, and turns it away from whom HE pleases. The 
      flash of its lightning may well-nigh take away the 
  sight.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
