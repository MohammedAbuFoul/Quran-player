          <TD>32. Who, then, is more unjust than he who lies against ALLAH and 
            he who rejects the truth when it comes to him ? Is there not in Hell 
            an abode for the disbelievers ? <BR>33. But he who has brought the 
            truth, and he who testifies to it as truth - these it is who are the 
            righteous. <BR>34. They will have with their Lord whatever they 
            desire; that is the reward of those who good. <BR>35. So that ALLAH 
            will remove from them the evil consequences of what they did, and 
            will give them their reward according to the best of their actions. 
            <BR>36. Is not ALLAH sufficient for HIS servant ? And yet they would 
            frighten thee with those beside HIM. And he whom ALLAH leaves in 
            error - for him there is no guide. <BR>37. And him whom ALLAH guides 
            - there is none to lead him astray. Is not ALLAH the Mighty, the 
            Lord of retribution ? <BR>38. And if thou ask them, `Who created the 
            heavens and the earth ?' They will, surely, say, `ALLAH.' Say, `What 
            think ye, if ALLAH intends to do me harm, will those whom you call 
            upon beside ALLAH be able to remove the harm HE may intend ? Or, if 
            HE wills to show me mercy, could they withhold HIS mercy ?' Say, 
            `ALLAH is sufficient for me. In HIM trust those who would trust.' 
            <BR>39. Say, `O my people, act as best as you can; I, too, am 
            acting; soon shall you know, <BR>40. Who it is unto whom comes a 
            punishment that will disgrace him, and on whom there descends an 
            abiding punishment ?'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
