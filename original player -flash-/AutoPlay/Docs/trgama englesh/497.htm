    <TD>19. `And exalt not yourselves in defiance of ALLAH. Surely, I come to 
      you with a clear authority, <BR>20. `And I seek refuge in my Lord and your 
      Lord, lest you stone me to death, <BR>21. `And if you believe me not, then 
      leave me alone.' <BR>22. Then Moses prayed unto his Lord, `These are, 
      indeed, a sinful people.' <BR>23. ALLAH said, `Take MY servants away by 
      night; for you will surely be pursued. <BR>24. `And leave thou the sea 
      behind when it is calm, crossing over the dunes. Surely, they are a host 
      that are doomed to be drowned.' <BR>25. How many were the gardens and the 
      springs that they left behind, <BR>26. And the cornfields and the noble 
      places, <BR>27. And the comforts and luxuries wherein they took delight ! 
      <BR>28. Thus it happened. And WE made another people inherit these things. 
      <BR>29. And the heaven and the earth wept not for them, nor were they 
      respited. <BR>30. And WE delivered the Children of Israel from the abasing 
      torment <BR>31. Inflicted by Pharaoh. He was, surely, haughty even among 
      the extravagant. <BR>32. And WE chose them above the peoples of their time 
      knowingly. <BR>33. And WE gave them Signs wherein was a clear trial. 
      <BR>34. These people do say, <BR>35. `There is only one death for us, and 
      we shall not be raised up again, <BR>36. `So bring back our fathers, if 
      you speak the truth.' <BR>37. Are they better or the people of Tubba and 
      those before them ? WE destroyed them because they were sinful. <BR>38. 
      And WE created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them 
      in sport. <BR>39. WE created them not but for an eternal purpose, but most 
      of them understand not.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
