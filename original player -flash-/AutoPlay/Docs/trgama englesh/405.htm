    <TD>6. ALLAH has made this promise. ALLAH breaks not HIS promise, but most 
      men know not. <BR>7. They know only the outer part of the life of this 
      world, and of the Hereafter they are utterly unmindful. <BR>8. Do they not 
      reflect within themselves that ALLAH has not created the heavens and the 
      earth and all that is between the two but in accordance with the 
      requirements of wisdom and for a fixed term ? But many among men believe 
      not in the meeting with their Lord. <BR>9. Have they not traveled in the 
      earth so that they might see how evil was the end of those who were before 
      them ? They were stronger than these in power, and they tilled the soil 
      and populated it more and better than these have populated it. And their 
      Messengers came to them with manifest Signs. And ALLAH would not wrong 
      them, but they wronged their own souls. <BR>10. Then evil was the end of 
      those who did evil, because, they rejected the Signs of ALLAH and scoffed 
      at them. <BR>11. ALLAH originates creation; then HE keeps repeating it; 
      then to HIM shall you be brought back. <BR>12. And on the day when the 
      Hour will arrive the guilty shall be seized with despair. <BR>13. And they 
      shall have no intercessors from among those who they associate with ALLAH; 
      and they will deny those whom they associate with HIM. <BR>14. And on the 
      day when the Hour will arrive - on that day they will become separated 
      from one another. <BR>15. Then those who believed and acted righteously 
      will be honoured and made happy in stately 
gardens.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
