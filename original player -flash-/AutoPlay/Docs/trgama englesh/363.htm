    <TD>33. And they do not come to thee with an objection but WE provide thee 
      with the truth and an excellent explanation. <BR>34. Those who will be 
      gathered unto Hell on their faces -they will be the worst in plight and 
      most astray from the right path. <BR>35. WE gave Moses the Book, and 
      appointed with him his brother Aaron as his assistant. <BR>36. And WE said 
      to them, `Go both of you to the people who have rejected OUR Signs;' Then 
      WE destroyed them utterly. <BR>37. And the people of Noah, when they 
      rejected the Messengers, WE drowned them, and WE made them a Sign for 
      mankind. And WE have prepared a painful punishment for the wrongdoers. 
      <BR>38. And WE destroyed Ad and Thamud, and the People of the Well, and 
      many a generation between them, <BR>39. And to each one WE set forth 
      examples; and each one WE utterly destroyed. <BR>40. And these Meccans 
      must have visited the town whereon was rained an evil rain. Have they not 
      seen it ? Nay, they expect not to be raised after death. <BR>41. And when 
      they see thee, they only make a jest of thee, and say, `What ! is this he 
      whom ALLAH has sent as a Messenger ? <BR>42. `He indeed had well-nigh led 
      us astray from our gods, had we not steadily adhered to them.' And they 
      shall no, when they see the punishment, who is most astray from the right 
      path. <BR>43. Hast thou seen him who takes his own evil desire for his god 
      ? Canst thou be a guardian over them 
?&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
