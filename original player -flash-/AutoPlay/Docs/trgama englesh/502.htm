    <TD>33. And the evil consequences of their deeds will become apparent to 
      them, and that which they used to mock at shall encompass them. <BR>34. 
      And it will be said to them, `This day shall WE abandon you without help, 
      even as you forgot the meeting of this your day. And your resort is the 
      Fire, and you will have no helpers; <BR>35. `This is so, because you made 
      a jest of the Signs of ALLAH, and the life of the world deceived you.' 
      Therefore that day they will not be taken out of it, nor will they be 
      taken back into favour. <BR>36. All praise, then, belongs to ALLAH, Lord 
      of the heavens and Lord of the earth, Lord of all the worlds. <BR>37. And 
      HE is the Majesty in the heavens and the earth, and HE is the Mighty, the 
      Wise. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. Ha Mim. <BR>2. The revelation of this Book is from ALLAH, the Mighty, 
      the Wise. <BR>3. And WE have not created the heavens and the earth and all 
      that is between them, but with an eternal purpose and for an appointed 
      term, but those who disbelieve turn away from that of which they have been 
      warned. <BR>4. Say to them, `Do you know what it is you call upon beside 
      ALLAH ? Show me what they have created of the earth. Or, have they a share 
      in the creation of the heavens ? Bring me a Book revealed before this or 
      some vestige of knowledge in your support, if you indeed, speak the 
      truth.' <BR>5. And who is in greater error than those who, instead of 
      ALLAH, pray unto such as will not answer them till the Day of 
      Resurrection, and they are not even aware of their prayer
