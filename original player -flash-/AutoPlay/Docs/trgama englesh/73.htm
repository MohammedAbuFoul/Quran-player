    <TD>174. So they returned with a mighty favour from ALLAH and a great 
      bounty, while no evil had touched them; and they followed the pleasure of 
      ALLAH; and ALLAH is the Lord of great bounty. <BR>175. It is Satan who 
      only frightens his friends, so fear them not but fear ME, if you are 
      believers. <BR>176. And let not those who hasten to fall into disbelief 
      grieve thee; surely, they cannot harm ALLAH in any way. ALLAH desires not 
      to assign them any portion in the life to come; and they shall have a 
      severe punishment. <BR>177. Surely those who have purchased disbelief at 
      the price of faith cannot harm ALLAH at all; and they shall have a 
      grievous punishment. <BR>178. And let not the disbelievers think that OUR 
      granting them respite is good for them; in fact the result of OUR granting 
      them respite will only be that they will increase in sin; and they shall 
      have an humiliating punishment. <BR>179. ALLAH would not leave the 
      believers in the state in which you are, until HE separated the wicked 
      from the good. Nor would ALLAH reveal to you the unseen. But ALLAH chooses 
      of HIS Messengers whom HE pleases. Believe therefore in ALLAH and HIS 
      Messengers. If you believe and be righteous, you shall have a great 
      reward. <BR>180. And let not those who are niggardly in spending what 
      ALLAH has given them of HIS bounty, think that it is good for them; nay, 
      it is bad for them. That with respect to which they were niggardly shall 
      be put as a collar round their necks on the Day of Resurrection. And to 
      ALLAH belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth, and ALLAH is 
      fully Aware of what you do.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
