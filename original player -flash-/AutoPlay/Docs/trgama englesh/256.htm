    <TD>6. And call to mind when Moses said to his people, `Remember ALLAH's 
      favour upon you when HE delivered you from Pharaoh's people who afflicted 
      you with grievous torment, slaying your sons and sparing your women; and 
      in that there was a great trial for you from your Lord.' <BR>7. And when 
      your Lord declared: `If you are grateful, I will surely bestow more 
      favours on you; but if you are ungrateful, then know that MY punishment is 
      severe indeed.' <BR>8. And Moses said, `If you disbelieve, you and those 
      who are in the earth all together, you can do no harm to ALLAH; verily, 
      ALLAH is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.' <BR>9. Have not the tidings come 
      to you of those before you, the people of Noah and the tribes of Ad and 
      Thamud and those after them ? None knows them now save ALLAH. Their 
      Messengers came to them with clear Signs, but they trust their hands into 
      their mouths and said, `We disbelieve in what you have sent with and 
      surely, we are disquieting doubt concerning that to which you call us.' 
      <BR>10. The Messengers said, `Are you in doubt concerning ALLAH, Maker of 
      the heavens and the earth ? HE calls you that HE may forgive you your sins 
      and grant you respite till an appointed term.' They said, `You are but 
      mortals like us, you desire to turn us away from that which our fathers 
      used to worship. Bring us, then, some clear 
proof.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
