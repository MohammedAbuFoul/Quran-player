    <TD>31. But whoever of you is obedient to ALLAH and HIS Messenger and does 
      good works, WE shall give her reward twice over; and WE have prepared for 
      her an honourable provision. <BR>32. O wives of the Prophet ! you are not 
      like any other women if you are righteous. So be not soft in speech, lest 
      he, in whose heart is a disease, should feel tempted; and speak decent 
      words. <BR>33. And stay in your houses with dignity, and display not your 
      beauty like the displaying of the former days of ignorance, and observe 
      Prayer, and pay the Zakat, and obey ALLAH and HIS Messenger. Surely, ALLAH 
      desires to remove from you all uncleanness, O Members of the Household, 
      and purify you completely. <BR>34. And remember what is rehearsed in your 
      houses of the Signs of ALLAH and wisdom. Verily, ALLAH is Subtle, 
      All-Aware. <BR>35. Surely, men who submit themselves to GOD and women who 
      submit themselves to HIM, and believing men and believing women, and 
      obedient men and obedient women, and truthful men and truthful women, and 
      men steadfast in their faith and steadfast women, and men who are humble 
      and women who are humble, and men who give alms and women who give alms, 
      and men who fast and women who fast, and men who guard their chastity and 
      women who guard their chastity and men who remember ALLAH much and women 
      who remember HIM - ALLAH has prepared for all of them forgiveness and a 
      great reward.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
