    <TD>96. And if the people of those towns had believed and been righteous, 
      WE would have surely opened for them blessings from heaven and earth; but 
      they disbelieved, so WE seized them because of that which they earned. 
      <BR>97. Are the people of these towns then secure from the coming of Our 
      punishment upon them by night while they are asleep ? <BR>98. And are the 
      people of these towns secure from the coming of Our punishment upon them 
      in the early part of the forenoon while they play ? <BR>99. Are they then 
      secure from the design of ALLAH ? And none feels secure from the design of 
      ALLAH save the people who are destined to perish. <BR>100. Does it not 
      lead those, who have inherited the earth in succession to its former 
      inhabitants, to realize that if WE please, WE can smite them also for 
      their sins and seal up their hearts, so that they would not listen to 
      words of guidance. <BR>101. Such were the towns some of whose news WE have 
      related to thee. And verily the Messengers came to them with clear Signs. 
      But they would not believe what they had rejected before. Thus does ALLAH 
      seal up the hearts of the disbelievers. <BR>102. And WE found not in most 
      of them any observance of covenant and, surely, WE found most of them to 
      be evil-doers. <BR>103. Then, after them, WE sent Moses with Our Signs to 
      Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they unjustly rejected them. Behold, then, 
      what was the end of those who created disorder ! <BR>104. And Moses said, 
      `O Pharaoh, surely, I am a Messenger from the Lord of the 
  worlds;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
