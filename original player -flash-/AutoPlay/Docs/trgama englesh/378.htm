    <TD>14. And they rejected them wrongfully and arrogantly, while their 
      souls were convinced of their truth. See then, how evil was the end of 
      those who acted corruptly ! <BR>15. And WE gave knowledge to David and 
      Solomon and they said, `All praise belongs to ALLAH, Who has exalted us 
      above many of HIS believing servants.' <BR>16. And Solomon was heir to 
      David. And he said, `O ye people, we have been taught the language of 
      birds, and we have had all necessary things bestowed upon us. This indeed

      punishment or I will slay him, unless he brings me a clear reason for his 
      absence. <BR>22. And he did not tarry long before Hudhud came and said, `I 
      have acquired knowledge of that of which thou hast no knowledge; and I
