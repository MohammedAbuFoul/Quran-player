    <TD>89. `And O my people, let not your hostility towards me lead you to 
      this that there should befall you the like of that which befell the people 
      of Noah or the people of Hud or the people of Salih; and the people of Lot 
      are not far from you; <BR>90. `And seek forgiveness of your Lord; then 
      turn wholly to HIM. Verily, my Lord is Merciful, Most Loving.' <BR>91. 
      They replied, `O Shu'aib, we do not understand much of what thou sayest, 
      and surely we see that thou art weak among us. And were it not for thy 
      tribe, we would surely stone thee. And thou holdest no strong position 
      among us.' <BR>92. He replied, `O my people, is my tribe mightier with you 
      than ALLAH ? And you have cast HIM behind your backs as a thing neglected. 
      Surely, my Lord encompasses all that you do; <BR>93. `And O my people, act 
      according to your power. I, too, am acting. You will soon know on whom 
      descends a punishment that will disgrace him, and who it is that is a 
      liar. And wait; I too wait with you.' <BR>94. And when OUR decree came to 
      pass WE saved Shu'aib, and those who had believed with him by OUR special 
      mercy; and chastisement seized those who had done wrong, so that they lay 
      prostrate in their houses, <BR>95. As though they had never dwelt therein. 
      So perished Midian even as Thamud had perished. <BR>96. And, surely, WE 
      sent Moses with Our Signs and manifest authority, <BR>97. To Pharaoh and 
      his chiefs; but they followed the command of Pharaoh, and the command of 
      Pharaoh was not at all 
rightful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
