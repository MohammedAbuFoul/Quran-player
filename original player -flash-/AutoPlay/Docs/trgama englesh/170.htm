    <TD>156. And ordain for us good in this world, as well as in the next; we 
      have turned to Thee with repentance.' ALLAH replied, `I will inflict MY 
      punishment on whom I will; but MY mercy encompasses all things; so I will 
      ordain it for those who act righteously and pay the Zakaat and those who 
      believe in Our Signs - <BR>157. Those who follow the Messenger, the 
      Prophet, the Ummi whom they find mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel 
      which are with them. He enjoins on them good and forbids them evil and 
      makes lawful for them the good things and forbids them the bad things and 
      remove from them their burdens and shackles that were upon them. So those 
      who shall believe in him and honour and support him and help him and 
      follow the light that has been sent down with him - these shall prosper.' 
      <BR>158. Say, `O mankind, truly I am a Messenger to you all from ALLAH to 
      Whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no god but 
      HE. HE gives life and HE causes death. So believe in ALLAH and HIS 
      Messenger, the Ummi Prophet, who believes in ALLAH and HIS words; and 
      follow him that you may be rightly guided.' <BR>159. And of the people of 
      Moses there is a party who guide with truth and do justice 
    therewith.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
