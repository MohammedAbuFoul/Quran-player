    <TD>21. Their Lord gives them glad tidings of mercy from HIM, and of HIS 
      pleasure, and Gardens wherein there shall be lasting bliss for them; 
      <BR>22. They will abide therein forever. Verily, with ALLAH there is a 
      great reward. <BR>23. O ye who believe ! take not your fathers and 
      brothers for friends if they prefer disbelieve to faith. And whoso of you 
      takes them for friends, such are the wrongdoers. <BR>24. Say, if your 
      fathers and sons and your brethren and your wives and your kinsfolk and 
      the wealth you have acquired and the trade whose dullness you fear and the 
      dwellings which you love are dearer to you than ALLAH and HIS Messenger 
      and striving in HIS cause, then wait until ALLAH brings about HIS 
      judgment; and ALLAH guides not the disobedient people. <BR>25. Surely, 
      ALLAH has helped you on many a battle field and on the day of Hunain, when 
      your great numbers made you proud, but they availed you naught; and the 
      earth, with all its vastness, became straitened for you, and then you 
      turned back retreating. <BR>26. Then ALLAH sent down HIS peace upon HIS 
      Messenger and upon the believers, and HE sent down host which you did not 
      see, and HE punished those who disbelieved. And this is the reward of the 
      disbelievers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
