    <TD>17. Their case is like the case of a person who kindled a fire, and 
      when it lighted up all around him, ALLAH took away their light and left 
      them in thick darkness, they see not. <BR>18. They are deaf, dumb and 
      blind; so they will not return. <BR>19. Or, it is like a heavy rain from 
      the clouds, wherein is thick darkness and thunder and lightning; they put 
      their fingers into their ears because of the thunder claps for fear of 
      death, and ALLAH encompasses the disbelievers. <BR>20. The lightning might 
      well nigh snatch away their sight; whenever it shines upon them, they walk 
      therein; and when it becomes dark to them, they stand still. And if ALLAH 
      had so willed HE could take away their hearing and their sight; surely 
      ALLAH has the power to do all that HE wills. <BR>21. O ye men ! worship 
      your Lord WHO created you and those before you, that you may guard against 
      evil. <BR>22. WHO made the earth a bed for you, and the heaven a roof, and 
      caused water to come down from the clouds and therewith brought forth 
      fruits for your sustenance; so do not set up equals to ALLAH, while you 
      know. <BR>23. And if you are in doubt as to what WE have sent down to OUR 
      servant, then produce a chapter like it, and call upon your helpers 
      besides ALLAH, if you are truthful. <BR>24. But if you do it not - and 
      never shall you do it - then guard against the Fire, whose fuel is men and 
      stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers.
