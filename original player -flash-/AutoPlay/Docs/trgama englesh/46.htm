    <TD>270. And whatsoever you spend or whatsoever you vow, ALLAH surely 
      knows it; and for the wrongdoers there shall be no helpers. <BR>271. If 
      you give alms openly it is well and good; but if you hide them and give 
      them to the poor, it is better for you, And HE will remit from you many of 
      your evil deeds. And ALLAH is Aware of what you do. <BR>272. It is not thy 
      responsibility to make them follow the right path; But ALLAH guides 
      whosoever HE pleases. And whatever of wealth you spend, the benefit will 
      of it will be for yourselves, for, you spend not but to seek the favour of 
      ALLAH. And whatever of wealth you spend, it shall be paid back to you in 
      full and you shall not be wronged. <BR>273. Alms are for the poor who are 
      detained in the way of ALLAH and are unable to move about in the land. The 
      ignorant man imagines them to be free from want because of their 
      abstaining from begging. Thou shalt know them by their appearance, they do 
      not beg of men with importunity. And whatever of wealth you spend, Surely 
      ALLAH has perfect knowledge thereof. <BR>274. Those who spend their wealth 
      by night and day, secretly and openly, have their reward with their Lord; 
      on them shall come no fear nor shall they 
grieve.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
