    <TD>4. That is because they opposed ALLAH and HIS Messenger; and whoso 
      opposes ALLAH - then, surely, ALLAH is severe in retribution. <BR>5. 
      Whatever palm tree you cut down, or left standing on their roots, it was 
      by ALLAH's leave that HE might humiliate the transgressors. <BR>6. And 
      whatever ALLAH has given to HIS Messenger as spoils from them, is of 
      ALLAH's grace. You urged neither horse nor camel for that; but ALLAH gives 
      authority to HIS Messengers over whomsoever HE pleases; and ALLAH has 
      power over all things. <BR>7. Whatever ALLAH has given to HIS Messenger as 
      spoils from the people of the towns, it is for ALLAH and for the Messenger 
      and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, in 
      order that it may not circulate only among those of you who are rich. And 
      whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids 
      you, abstain from it. And fear ALLAH, surely, ALLAH is Severe in 
      retribution. <BR>8. And it is also for the poor refugees who have been 
      driven out from their homes and their possessions; they seek the grace of 
      ALLAH and HIS pleasure; and help ALLAH and HIS Messenger. These it is who 
      are true in their faith; <BR>9. And for those who had established their 
      home in this City and had accepted the Faith before them. They love those 
      who come to them for refuge, and find not in their breasts any desire for 
      that which is given them (the Refugees), but give preference to the 
      Refugees above themselves, even though poverty be their own lot. Whoso is 
      rid of the covetousness of his own soul - it is these who will be 
      successful;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
