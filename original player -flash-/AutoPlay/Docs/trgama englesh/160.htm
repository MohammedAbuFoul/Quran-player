    <TD>74. And remember the time when HE made you heirs to HIS favours after 
      Ad and settled you in the land so that you build palaces in its plains and 
      hew the mountains into dwellings. Remember, therefore, the favours of 
      ALLAH and commit not iniquity in the earth causing disorder.' <BR>75. The 
      chief men of his people who were arrogant said to those who were 
      considered weak - those among them who believed -`Do you know for certain 
      that Salih is one sent by his Lord ?' They answered, `Surely, we believe 
      in that which he has been sent.' <BR>76. Those who were arrogant said, 
      `Verily, we do disbelieve in that which you believe.' <BR>77. Then they 
      hamstrung the she-camel and revolted against the command of their Lord and 
      said, `O Salih, bring us that which thou threatenest us with, if thou art 
      indeed one of the Messengers.' <BR>78. So the earthquake seized them and 
      in their homes they lay prostrate upon the ground. <BR>79. Then Salih 
      turned away from them and said, `O my people, I delivered the Message of 
      my Lord unto you and offered you sincere counsel, but you love not sincere 
      counsellors.' <BR>80. And WE sent Lot, when he said to his people, `Do you 
      commit an abomination such as no one in the world ever did before you ? 
      <BR>81. You approach men with lust instead of women. Nay, you are a people 
      who exceed all bounds.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
