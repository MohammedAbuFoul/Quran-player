    <TD>104. And when it is said to them, `Come to what ALLAH has revealed, 
      and to the Messenger,' they say, `Sufficient for us is that wherein we 
      found our fathers.' What ! even though their fathers had no knowledge and 
      had no guidance. <BR>105. O ye who believe ! take care of your own selves. 
      He who goes astray cannot harm you when you yourselves are rightly guided. 
      To ALLAH will you all return; then HE will inform you of what you used do. 
      <BR>106. O ye who believe ! the right evidence among you, when death comes 
      to one of you, at the time of making a will, is of two just men from among 
      you; or of two others not from among you, in case you be journeying in the 
      land and the calamity of death befalls you. You shall detain them both 
      after Prayer for giving evidence; and if you have doubt concerning their 
      evidence, they shall both swear by ALLAH, saying, `We will not take for 
      this any price, even though the person affected thereby be a near 
      relation, nor will we hide the testimony enjoined by ALLAH; surely in that 
      case we shall be among the sinners.' <BR>107. But if it be discovered that 
      the two witnesses are guilty of sin, then two others shall take their 
      place from amongst those against whom the former two witnesses - who were 
      in a better position to give true evidence - had deposed, and the two 
      latter witnesses shall swear by ALLAH, saying, `Surely our testimony is 
      truer than the testimony of the former two, and we have not been unfair in 
      any way; for then, indeed, we should be of the unjust.' <BR>108. Thus it 
      is more likely that they will give evidence according to facts or that 
      they will fear that other oaths will be taken after their oaths. And fear 
      ALLAH and hearken. And ALLAH guides not the disobedient 
  people.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
