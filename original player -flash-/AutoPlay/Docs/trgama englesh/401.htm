    <TD>39. And WE destroyed Korah and Pharaoh and Haman. And Moses did come 
      to them with manifest Signs, but they behaved arrogantly in the land, yet 
      they could not outstrip Us. <BR>40. So each one of them WE seized for his 
      sin; of them were those against whom WE sent a violent sandstorm, and of 
      them were those whom a roaring blast overtook, and of them were those whom 
      WE caused the earth to swallow up, and of them were those whom WE drowned. 
      And ALLAH did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves. <BR>41. The 
      case of those who take helpers beside ALLAH is like unto the case of the 
      spider that takes to itself a house; and, surely, the frailest of all 
      houses is the house of the spider, if they but knew. <BR>42. Verily, ALLAH 
      knows whatever they call upon beside HIM; and HE is the Mighty, the Wise. 
      <BR>43. And these are similitudes which WE set forth for mankind, but only 
      those understand them who have knowledge. <BR>44. ALLAH created the 
      heavens and the earth in accordance with the requirements of wisdom. In 
      that, surely, is a Sign for the believers. <BR>45. Recite that which has 
      been revealed of the Book and observe Prayer. Surely, Prayer restrains one 
      from indecency and manifest evil; and the remembrance of ALLAH is the 
      greatest virtue. And ALLAH knows what you 
do.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
