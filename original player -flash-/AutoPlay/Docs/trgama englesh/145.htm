    <TD>132. And for all are degrees of rank according to what they do, and 
      thy Lord is not unmindful of what they do. <BR>133. And thy Lord is Self 
      Sufficient, Lord of mercy. If HE please, HE can do away with you and cause 
      to succeed you whom HE pleases, even as HE raised you from the posterity 
      of other people. <BR>134. Surely that which you are promised shall come to 
      pass and you cannot frustrate it. <BR>135. Say, `O my people, act 
      according to your power. I too am acting. Soon will you know whose will be 
      the ultimate reward of the abode.' Surely, the wrongdoers shall not 
      prosper. <BR>136. And they have assigned ALLAH a portion of the crops and 
      cattle which HE has produced, and they say, `This is for ALLAH,' -so they 
      assert - `and this is for our associate-gods.' But that which is for their 
      associate-gods reaches not ALLAH while that which is for ALLAH reaches 
      their associate-gods. Evil is what they judge. <BR>137. And in the like 
      manner have their associate-gods made the slaying of their children seem 
      fair to many of the idolaters that they may ruin them and cause confusion 
      in their religion. And if ALLAH had enforced HIS will, they would not have 
      done this; so leave them alone with that which they 
  invent.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
