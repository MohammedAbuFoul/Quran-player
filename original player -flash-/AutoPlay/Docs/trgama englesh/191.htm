    <TD>27. Then after such punishment ALLAH turns with compassion to 
      whomsoever HE pleases; and ALLAH is Most Forgiving. <BR>28. O ye who 
      believe ! surely, the idolaters are unclean. So they shall not approach 
      the Sacred Mosque after this year of theirs. And if you fear poverty, 
      ALLAH will enrich you out of HIS bounty, if HE pleases. Surely, ALLAH is 
      All-Knowing, Wise. <BR>29. Fight those from among the people of the Book, 
      who believe not in ALLAH, nor in the Last Day, nor hold as unlawful what 
      ALLAH and HIS Messenger have declared to be unlawful, nor follow the true 
      religion, until they pay the tax considering it a favour and acknowledge 
      their subjection. <BR>30. And the Jews say, `Ezra is the son of ALLAH,' 
      and the Christians say, `the Messiah is the son of ALLAH;' that is what 
      they say with their mouths. They only imitate the saying of those who 
      disbelieved before them. ALLAH's curse be on them ! How they are turned 
      away. <BR>31. They have taken their priest and their monks for lords 
      besides ALLAH. And so have they taken the Messiah, son of Mary. And they 
      were not commanded but to worship the One God. There is no God but HE. 
      Holy is HE far above what they associate with Him
