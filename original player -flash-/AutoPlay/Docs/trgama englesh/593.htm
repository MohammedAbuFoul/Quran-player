    <TD>1. By the Dawn, <BR>2. And the Ten Nights, <BR>3. And the Even and the 
      Odd, <BR>4. And the night when it moves on to its close, <BR>5. Is there 
      not in it strong evidence for one possessed of understanding ? <BR>6. Hast 
      thou not see how thy Lord dealt with Ad - <BR>7. The tribe if Iram, 
      possessors of lofty buildings ? <BR>8. The like of whom have not been 
      created in these parts - <BR>9. And with Thamud who hewed out rocks in the 
      valley, <BR>10. And with Pharaoh, lord of vast hosts, <BR>11. Who 
      committed excesses in the cities, <BR>12. And wrought much corruption 
      therein ? <BR>13. Thy Lord, then, let loose on them the scourge of 
      punishment. <BR>14. Surely, thy Lord is ever on the watch. <BR>15. As for 
      man, when his Lord tries him and honours him and bestows favours on him, 
      he says, `My Lord has honoured me.' <BR>16. But when HE tries and 
      straitens for him his means of subsistence, he says, `My Lord has 
      disgraced me.' <BR>17. Nay, but you honour not the orphan, <BR>18. And 
      urge not one another to feed the poor; <BR>19. And devour the heritage of 
      other people, devouring greedily and wholly; <BR>20. And you love wealth 
      with exceeding love. <BR>21. Hearken ! when the earth is completely broken 
      into pieces; <BR>22. And thy Lord comes attended by angels, rank on rank; 
      <BR>23. And Hell is brought near that day; on that day man will remember, 
      but of what avail shall that remembrance be to him 
?&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
