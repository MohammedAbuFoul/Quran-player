    <TD>87. `O my sons, go ye and inquire about Joseph and his brother and 
      despair not of the mercy of ALLAH; for none despairs of ALLAH's mercy save 
      the disbelieving people.' <BR>88. And when they came before Joseph again, 
      they said, `O noble chief, poverty has smitten us and our family, and we 
      have brought a paltry sum of money, but nonetheless give us full measure, 
      and be charitable to us. Surely, ALLAH does reward the charitable.' 
      <BR>89. He said, `Do you know what you did to Joseph and his brother in 
      ignorance ?' <BR>90. They replied, `Art thou Joseph ?' He said, `Yes, I am 
      Joseph and this is my brother. ALLAH has indeed been gracious to us. 
      Verily, whoso fears ALLAH and is steadfast - ALLAH never suffers the 
      reward of the good to be lost.' <BR>91. They replied, `By ALLAH; surely, 
      ALLAH has preferred thee above us and we have indeed been sinners.' 
      <BR>92. He said, `No blame shall lie on you this day; may ALLAH forgive 
      you ! And HE is the Most Merciful of those Who show mercy. <BR>93. Go with 
      this shirt of mine and lay it before my father; he will come to know 
      everything. And bring to me the whole of your family.' <BR>94. And when 
      the caravan departed, their father said, `Surely, I perceive the scent of 
      Joseph, even though you take me to be a dotard.' <BR>95. They replied, `By 
      ALLAH, thou art assuredly still in thy old 
error.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
