    <TD>43. Their eyes will be cast down, and humiliation will cover them; and 
      they were, indeed, called upon to prostrate themselves when they were safe 
      and sound, but they did not. <BR>44. So leave ME to deal with those who 
      reject this word of Ours. WE shall draw them near to destruction step by 
      step whence they know not. <BR>45. And I shall grant them long respite; 
      for MY plan is sure. <BR>46. Dost thou ask a reward of them that they feel 
      weighed down by its burden ? <BR>47. Have they the knowledge of the unseen 
      so that they write it down ? <BR>48. So be thou steadfast in carrying out 
      the command of thy Lord, and be not like the Man of the Fish when he 
      called to his Lord and he was full of grief. <BR>49. Had it not been that 
      a favour from his Lord had reached him, he would have, surely, been cast 
      upon a barren waste to be blamed by his people. <BR>50. But his Lord chose 
      him and placed him among the righteous. <BR>51. And those who disbelieve 
      would fain have dislodged thee from thy God-given station with their angry 
      looks when they heard the Reminder; and they keep saying, `He is, 
      certainly, mad.' <BR>52. Nay, it is naught but a source of honour for all 
      the worlds. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. The Inevitable ! <BR>2. What is the Inevitable ? <BR>3. And what should 
      make thee know what the Inevitable is ? <BR>4. The tribes of Thamud and Ad 
      treated as a lie the sudden calamity. <BR>5. Then, as for Thamud, they 
      were destroyed with a blast of utmost fury. <BR>6. And as for Ad, they 
      were destroyed by a fierce howling wind, <BR>7. Which God caused to blow 
      against them for seven nights and eight days continuously, so that thou 
      mightest have seen the people therein lying prostrate, as though they were 
      trunks of palm trees fallen down. <BR>8. Dost thou see any trace of them
