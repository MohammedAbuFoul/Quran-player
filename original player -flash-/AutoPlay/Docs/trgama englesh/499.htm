    <TD>1. Ha Mim. <BR>2. The revelation of this Book is from ALLAH, the 
      Mighty, the Wise. <BR>3. Verily, in the heavens and the earth are Signs 
      for those who believe. <BR>4. And in your own creation and in that of all 
      the creatures which HE spreads in the earth are Signs for a people who 
      possess firm faith. <BR>5. And in the alternation of night and day, and 
      the provision that ALLAH sends down from the heaven, whereby HE quickens 
      the earth after its death, and in the changing of the winds, are Signs for 
      a people who would use their understanding. <BR>6. These are the Signs of 
      ALLAH which WE rehearse unto thee with truth. In what word, then, after 
      rejecting the Word of ALLAH and HIS Signs, will they believe ? <BR>7. Woe 
      to every sinful liar, <BR>8. Who hears the Signs of ALLAH recited unto 
      him, and then proudly persists in disbelief, as though he heard them not. 
      So give him the tidings of a painful punishment. <BR>9. And when he learns 
      something of Our Signs, he makes a jest of them. For such there is an 
      humiliating punishment. <BR>10. Before them is Hell; and that which they 
      have earned shall not avail them aught, nor shall those whom the have 
      taken for protectors beside ALLAH. And they will have a dreadful 
      punishment. <BR>11. This is true guidance. And for those who disbelieve in 
      the Signs of their Lord is the torture of a painful punishment. <BR>12. 
      ALLAH is HE who has subjected the sea to you that ships may sail thereon 
      by HIS command, and that you may seek of HIS bounty, and that you may be 
      grateful. <BR>13. And HE has subjected to you whatsoever is in the heavens 
      and whatsoever is in the earth; all this is from HIM. In that, surely, are 
      Signs for a people who 
reflect.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
