    <TD>131. But whenever good befell them, they said, `This is for us.' And 
      if evil afflicted them, they ascribed the evil fortune to Moses and those 
      with him. Now, surely, the cause of their evil fortune was with ALLAH. But 
      most of them know not. <BR>132. And they said, `Whatever Sign thou mayest 
      bring to us to bewitch us with, we will not submit to thee.' <BR>133. Then 
      WE sent upon them the storm and the locust and the lice and the frogs and 
      the blood - clear Signs; but they behaved proudly and were a sinful 
      people. <BR>134. And when there fell upon them the punishment, they said, 
      `O Moses, pray for us to thy Lord according to that which HE has promised 
      to thee. If thou remove from us the punishment, we will surely believe 
      thee and we will surely send with thee the Children of Israel.' <BR>135. 
      But when WE removed from them the punishment for a term which they were to 
      reach, lo ! they broke their promise. <BR>136. So WE took vengeance upon 
      them and drowned them in the sea, because they treated Our Signs as lies 
      and were heedless of them. <BR>137. And WE caused the people who were 
      considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western 
      parts thereof, which WE blessed. And the gracious word of thy Lord was 
      fulfilled for the Children of Israel because they were steadfast; and WE 
      utterly destroyed all that Pharaoh and his people has built and all that 
      they had erected.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
