    <TD>75. And if WE had mercy on them and relieved them of their affliction, 
      they would persist in their transgression, wandering blindly. <BR>76. WE 
      had already seized them with punishment, but they humbled not themselves 
      before their Lord, nor they would supplicate in lowliness; <BR>77. Until, 
      when WE open on them a door of severe punishment, lo ! they are in despair 
      thereat. <BR>78. And HE it is Who has created for you ears and eyes and 
      hearts, but little thanks do you give. <BR>79. And HE it is Who has 
      multiplied you in the earth, and unto HIM you shall be gathered. <BR>80. 
      And HE it is Who give life and causes death, and in HIS control is the 
      alternation of night and day. Will you not then understand ? <BR>81. But 
      they say things similar to what the former people said. <BR>82. They say, 
      `What ! when we are dead and have become mere dust and bones, shall we, 
      indeed, be raised up again ? <BR>83. `This is what we have been promised 
      before, we and our fathers. This is nothing but fables of the ancients.' 
      <BR>84. Say, `To whom belongs the earth and whosoever is therein, if you 
      know ?' <BR>85. `To ALLAH,' they will say. Say, `Will you not then be 
      admonished ?' <BR>86. Say, `Who is the Lord of the seven Heavens, and the 
      Lord of the Great Throne ?' <BR>87. They will say, `They are ALLAH's.' 
      Say, `Will you not then take HIM as your Protector ?' <BR>88. Say, `In 
      whose hand is the dominion of all things and who protects, but against 
      Whom there is no protection, if you know ?' <BR>89. They will say, `All 
      this belongs to ALLAH.' Say, `How then are you being deluded 
  ?'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
