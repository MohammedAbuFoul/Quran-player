    <TD>21. And most surely WE will make them taste of the lesser punishment 
      before the greater punishment, that they may return to US with repentance. 
      <BR>22. And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the Signs of his 
      Lord and then turns away from them ? WE will, surely, exact retribution 
      from the guilty. <BR>23. And WE indeed gave Moses the Book - be not, 
      therefore, in doubt about receiving a perfect Book thyself - and WE made 
      it a guidance for the Children of Israel. <BR>24. And WE appointed from 
      among them leaders, who guided the people by Our command, because they 
      were steadfast and had firm faith in Our Signs. <BR>25. Verily, thy Lord - 
      HE will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that in 
      which they used to disagree. <BR>26. Does it not furnish guidance to them 
      how many a generation have WE destroyed before them, amid whose dwellings 
      they now walk about ? In that, surely, are Signs. Will they not then 
      listen ? <BR>27. Do they not see that WE drive the water to the dry land 
      and produce thereby crops of which their cattle eat, and they themselves 
      also ? Will they not then see ? <BR>28. And they say, `When will this 
      victory come, if you are truthful ?' <BR>29. Say, `On the day of victory 
      the faith of the disbelievers shall not avail them, nor will they be 
      respited.' <BR>30. So turn away from them, and wait. They are also 
      waiting.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
