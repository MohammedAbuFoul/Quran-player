    <TD>63. People ask thee concerning the Hour. Say, `The knowledge of it is 
      with ALLAH alone.' And what will make thee know that the Hour may be nigh 
      ? <BR>64. ALLAH has, surely, cursed the disbelievers, and has prepared for 
      them a blazing fire, <BR>65. Wherein they will abide forever. They will 
      find therein no friend, nor helper. <BR>66. On the day when their faces 
      are turned over into the fire they will say, `O, would that we had obeyed 
      ALLAH and obeyed the Messenger !' <BR>67. And they will say, `Our Lord, we 
      obeyed our chiefs and our great ones and they led us astray from the way, 
      <BR>68. `Our Lord, give them double punishment and curse them with a 
      mighty curse.' <BR>69. O ye who believe ! be not like those who maligned 
      Moses; but ALLAH cleared of what they said about him. And he had a great 
      position in the sight of ALLAH. <BR>70. O ye who believe ! Fear ALLAH and 
      say the straightforward word. <BR>71. HE will set right you actions for 
      you and forgive you your sins. And whoso obeys ALLAH and HIS Messenger 
      shall, surely, attain a supreme triumph. <BR>72. Verily, WE have offered 
      the trust of the Divine Law to the heavens and the earth and the 
      mountains, but they refused to bear it and were afraid of it. But man bore 
      it. Indeed, he is capable of being unjust to, and neglectful of, himself. 
      <BR>73. The consequence is that ALLAH will punish hypocritical men and 
      hypocritical women, and idolatrous men and idolatrous women; and ALLAH 
      turns in Mercy to believing men and believing women; and ALLAH is Most 
      forgiving Merciful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
