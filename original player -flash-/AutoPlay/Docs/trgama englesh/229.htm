    <TD>63. He said, `O my people, tell me, If I base my claim on a clear 
      proof from my Lord and HE has granted me a special mercy from Himself, who 
      then will help me against ALLAH, if I disobey HIM ? So you will only add 
      to my destruction; <BR>64. `And O my people, this is the she-camel of 
      ALLAH, a Sign for you, so leave her free that she may feed in ALLAH's 
      earth, and touch her not with harm lest a near punishment seize you.' 
      <BR>65. But they hamstrung her; then he said, `Enjoy yourselves in your 
      houses for three days. This is a promise which will not be belied. <BR>66. 
      And when Our command came to pass, WE saved Salih and those who believed 
      with him by Our special mercy from the ignominy of that day. Surely, thy 
      Lord is Powerful, Mighty. <BR>67. And punishment overtook those who done 
      wrong, and they lay prostrate in their houses, <BR>68. As though they had 
      never dwelt therein. Remember ! The Thamud believed not in their Lord. So 
      away with the tribe of Thamud. <BR>69. And surely, Our Messengers came to 
      Abraham with glad tidings. They said, `We bid you peace.' He answered, 
      `Peace be on you,' and he was not long in bringing a roasted calf. <BR>70. 
      But when he saw their hands not reaching thereto, he considered this 
      strange on their part and conceived fear of them. They said, `Fear not, we 
      have been sent to the people of Lot.' <BR>71. And his wife was standing by 
      and she too was frightened, whereupon to assure her we gave her glad 
      tidings of birth of Isaac, and, after Isaac, of 
Jacob.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
