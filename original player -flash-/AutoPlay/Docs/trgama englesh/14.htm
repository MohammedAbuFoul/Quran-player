    <TD>89. And when there came to them a book from ALLAH, fulfilling that 
      which is with them - and before that they have prayed for victory over the 
      disbelievers - yet when there came to them that which they knew to be the 
      truth, they rejected it. The curse of ALLAH be on the disbelievers. 
      <BR>90. Evil is that which they have sold their souls - that they should 
      disbelieve in what ALLAH has revealed, grudging that ALLAH should send 
      down HIS grace on whomsoever of HIS servants HE pleases. So they have 
      incurred wrath upon wrath; and there is a humiliating chastisement for the 
      disbelievers.<BR>91. And when it is said to them `Believe in what ALLAH 
      has sent down,' they say `We believe in what has been sent down to us;' 
      and they disbelieve in what has been sent down after that, yet it is the 
      Truth, fulfilling that which is with them. Say `Why, then, do you seek to 
      slay the Prophets of ALLAH before this, if you were believers.<BR>92. And 
      Moses came to you with manifest Signs, then you took the calf for worship 
      in his absence, and you were transgressors. <BR>93. And remember the time 
      when WE took a covenant from you and raised high above you the Mount, 
      saying `Hold firmly to what WE have given you and hearken;' They said, `We 
      hear and we disobey;' and their hearts were saturated with the love of the 
      calf because of their disbelieve. Say `Evil is that which your faith 
      enjoins on you if you are 
believers,'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
