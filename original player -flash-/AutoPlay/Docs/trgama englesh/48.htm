    <TD>282. O ye who believe ! When you borrow one from another for a fixed 
      period, then write it down. And let a scribe write it in your presence 
      faithfully; and no scribe should refuse to write, because ALLAH has taught 
      him, so let him write and let him who incurs the liability dictate, and he 
      should fear ALLAH, his Lord, and not diminish anything therefrom. But if 
      the person incurring the liability be of low understanding or be weak or 
      be unable himself to dictate, then let someone who can guard his interest 
      dictate with justice. And call two witnesses from among your men; and if 
      two men be not available, then a man and two women, of such as you approve 
      as witnesses, so that if either of the two women should forget, then one 
      may remind the other. And the witnesses should not refuse when they are 
      called. And be not averse to writing it down whether it be small or large, 
      along with its appointed time of payment. This is more equitable in the 
      sight of ALLAH and makes testimony surer and is more likely to save, but 
      if it be a transaction which ye carry out on the spot among yourselves 
      there is no blame on you if ye reduce it not to writing. But take 
      witnesses whenever ye make a commercial contract; and let neither scribe 
      nor witness suffer harm. If ye do (such harm), it would be wickedness in 
      you. So fear Allah; for it is Allah that teaches you. And Allah is well 
      acquainted with all things.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
