    <TD>102. Such is ALLAH, your Lord. There is no god but HE, the creator of 
      all things; so worship HIM. and HE is the Guardian over everything. 
      <BR>103. Eyes cannot reach HIM but HE reaches the eyes. And HE is the 
      incomprehensible, the All-Aware. <BR>104. Proofs have indeed come to you 
      from your Lord; so whoever sees, it is for HIS own good; and whoever 
      becomes blind, it is to his own loss. And I am not a guardian over you. 
      <BR>105. And thus do WE explain the Signs in various ways that the truth 
      may become established and that they may say, `Thou hast read out what 
      thou hast learnt' and that WE may explain it to a people who have no 
      knowledge. <BR>106. Follow that which has been revealed to thee from thy 
      Lord; there is no god but HE; and turn aside from the idolaters. <BR>107. 
      And if ALLAH had enforced HIS will, they would not have set up gods with 
      HIM. And WE have not made thee a keeper over them, nor art thou over them 
      a guardian. <BR>108. And abuse not those whom they call upon besides 
      ALLAH, lest they, out of spite, abuse ALLAH in their ignorance. Thus unto 
      every people have WE caused their doings to seem fair. Then unto their 
      Lord is their return; And HE will inform them of what they used to do. 
      <BR>109. And they swear by ALLAH their strongest oaths that if there came 
      to them a Sign, they would surely believe therein. Say, `Surely, Signs are 
      with ALLAH. And what should make you know that when the signs come, they 
      will not believe. <BR>110. And WE shall confound their hearts and their 
      eyes, for they believe not therein the first time, and WE shall leave them 
      in their transgression to wander in 
distraction.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
