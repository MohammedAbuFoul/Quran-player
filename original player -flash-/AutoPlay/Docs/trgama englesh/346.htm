    <TD>60. And those who give what they give while their hearts are full of 
      fear that to their Lord they will return - <BR>61. These it is who hasten 
      to do good works, and they are foremost in doing them. <BR>62. And WE 
      burden not any soul beyond its capacity, and with US is a Book that speaks 
      the truth, and they will not be wronged. <BR>63. But their hearts are 
      utterly heedless of this Book, and besides that, they have other evil 
      deeds which they do; <BR>64. Until, when WE seize with punishment those of 
      them who indulge in luxury, behold, they cry for help; <BR>65. Whereupon 
      WE say, `Cry not for help this day, surely, you shall not be helped by US, 
      <BR>66. `Verily, MY Signs were recited unto you, but you used to turn back 
      on your heels, <BR>67. `In arrogance, talking nonsense by night about the 
      Qur'an.' <BR>68. Have they not, then, pondered over the divine Word, or 
      has there come to them that which did not come to their fathers of old ? 
      <BR>69. Or, do they not recognize their Messenger, that they deny him ? 
      <BR>70. Or, do they say, `There is madness in him ?' Nay, he has brought 
      them the truth, and most of them hate the truth. <BR>71. And if the truth 
      had followed their desires, verily the heavens and the earth and whosoever 
      is therein would have been corrupted. Nay, WE have brought them their 
      admonition, but from their own admonition they now turn aside. <BR>72. Or, 
      dost thou ask of them any reward ? But the reward of thy Lord is Best; and 
      HE is the Best of providers. <BR>73. And, most surely, thou invitest them 
      to a right path. <BR>74. And those who believe not in the Hereafter, are 
      indeed deviating from that 
path.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
