    <TD>88. Then he produced for them a calf - a mere body which emitted a 
      lowing sound. Then he and his companions said, `This is your god, and the 
      god of Moses but he has forgotten it and left it behind.' <BR>89. Could 
      they not see that it returned to them no answer, and had no power to do 
      them either harm or good ? <BR>90. And Aaron had said to them before the 
      return of Moses, `O my people, you have only been tried by means of the 
      calf. And, surely, the Gracious God is your Lord, so follow me and obey my 
      command.' <BR>91. They replied, `We shall not cease to worship it until 
      Moses return to us.' <BR>92. Moses said, `O Aaron, what prevented thee, 
      when thou didst see them gone astray <BR>93. `From following me ? Didst 
      thou then disobey my command ?' <BR>94. Aaron answered, `Son of my mother, 
      seize me not by my beard, nor by the hair of my head. I feared lest thou 
      shouldst say: `Thou hast caused a division among the Children of Israel, 
      and didst not wait for my word.' <BR>95. Moses said, `And what then is thy 
      plea, O Samiry ?' <BR>96. He said, `I perceived what they perceived not. I 
      had only adopted part of what the Messenger (Moses) inculcated, but I 
      threw even that away. Thus it is that my mind commended to me.'<BR>97. 
      Moses said, `Begone then ! It shall be thine all this life to say to 
      everyone, `Touch me not,' and there is a promise of punishment for thee 
      which shall not fail to be fulfilled about thee. Now, look at thy god of 
      which thou hast become a devoted worshiper. WE will certainly burn it and 
      then WE will scatter its ashes into the sea; <BR>98. `Your God is only 
      ALLAH, there is no god but HE. HE comprehends all things in HIS 
      knowledge.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
