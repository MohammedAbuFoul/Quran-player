    <TD>114. There is no good in many of their conferences except the 
      conferences of such as enjoin charity, or goodness or the making of peace 
      among men. And whoso does that, seeking the pleasure of ALLAH, WE shall 
      soon bestow on him a great reward. <BR>115. And whoso opposes the 
      Messenger after guidance has become manifest to him, and follows a way 
      other than that of the believers, WE shall let him pursue the way he is 
      pursuing and shall cast him into Hell, and an evil destination it is. 
      <BR>116. ALLAH shall not forgive that anything be associated with HIM as 
      partner, but HE will forgive what is short of that to whomsoever HE 
      pleases. And whoso associates anything with ALLAH has indeed strayed far 
      away. <BR>117. They invoke besides HIM none but lifeless objects, and they 
      invoke none but Satan the rebellious, <BR>118. Whom ALLAH has cursed. He 
      said, `I will assuredly take a fixed portion from THY servants; <BR>119. 
      `And assuredly I will lead them astray and assuredly I will arouse in them 
      vain desires, and assuredly I will incite them and they will cut the ears 
      of cattle; and assuredly I will incite them and they will alter ALLAH's 
      creation.' And whoever takes Satan for a friend instead of ALLAH, he 
      certainly suffers a manifest loss. <BR>120. He holds out promises to them 
      and excites vain desires in them, and Satan promises them nothing but vain 
      things. <BR>121. For such, their abode shall be Hell, and they shall find 
      no way of escape from it.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
