          <TD>22. Thou wilt not find any people who believe in ALLAH and the 
            Last Day and yet they love those who oppose ALLAH and His Messenger, 
            even though they be their fathers, or their sons, or their brethren, 
            or their kindred. These are they in whose hearts ALLAH has inscribed 
            true faith and whom HE has strengthened with inspiration from 
            Himself. And HE will admit them into Gardens through which streams 
            flow. Therein they will abide; ALLAH is well-pleased with them and 
            they are well-pleased with HIM. They are ALLAH's party. Hearken ! it 
            is ALLAH's party who are the successful. <BR>&nbsp;
            <HR width="90%" color=#000000 SIZE=3>
            1. All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifies 
            ALLAH; and HE is the Mighty, the Wise. <BR>2. HE it is Who caused 
            the disbelievers of the People of the Book to go forth from their 
            homes at the time of the first banishment. You did not think that 
            they would go forth and they thought that their fortresses would 
            defend them against ALLAH. But ALLAH came upon them whence they did 
            not expect, and cast terror into their hearts, so that they 
            demolished their houses with their own hands and with the hands of 
            the believers. So take a lesson, O ye who have eyes. <BR>3. And had 
            it not been that ALLAH had decreed exile for them, HE would have, 
            surely, punished them otherwise in this world. And in the Hereafter 
            they will, certainly, have the punishment of the 
        Fire.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
