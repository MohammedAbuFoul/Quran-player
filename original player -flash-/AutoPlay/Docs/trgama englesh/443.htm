    <TD>41. And a Sign for them is that WE carry their offspring in the laden 
      ships. <BR>42. And WE will create for them the like thereof whereon they 
      will ride. <BR>43. And if WE so willed, WE could drown them; then they 
      would have no one to succour them, nor would they be rescued, <BR>44. 
      Except through mercy from US and a provision for a time. <BR>45. And when 
      it is said to them, `Guard yourselves against that which is before you 
      through Prayer and that which is behind you through repentance, that you 
      may receive mercy,' they turn away. <BR>46. And there comes not to them 
      any Sign out of the Signs of their Lord, but they turn away from it. 
      <BR>47. And when it is said to them, `Spend out of that which ALLAH has 
      given you,' those who disbelieve say to those who believe, `Shall we feed 
      him whom ALLAH would have fed, if HE had so willed ? You are but in 
      manifest error.' <BR>48. And they say, `When will this promise of 
      punishment be fulfilled, if you are truthful ?' <BR>49. They are waiting 
      only for a single blast which will seize them while they are still 
      disputing. <BR>50. And they will not be able to make a will nor will they 
      return to their families. <BR>51. And the trumpet shall be blown, and lo ! 
      from the graves they will hasten on to their Lord. <BR>52. They will say 
      to one another, `O woe to us ! who has raised us from our place of sleep ? 
      This is what the Gracious God had promised, and the Messengers, indeed, 
      spoke the truth.' <BR>53. It will be one blast and lo ! they will all be 
      brought before US. <BR>54. And on that day no soul will be wronged in 
      aught; nor will you be requited but for what you used to 
  do.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
