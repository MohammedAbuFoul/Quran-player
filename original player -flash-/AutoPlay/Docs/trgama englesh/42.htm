    <TD>253. These messengers have WE exalted some of them above others; among 
      them there are those to whom ALLAH spoke and some of them HE exalted in 
      degrees of rank and WE gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs and 
      strengthened him with the spirit of holiness. And if ALLAH had so willed, 
      those that came after them would not have fought with one another after 
      clear Signs had come to them; but they did disagree. Of them were some who 
      believed, and of them were some who disbelieved. And if ALLAH had so 
      willed, they would not have fought with one another; but ALLAH does what 
      HE desires. <BR>254. O ye who believe ! spend out of what WE have bestowed 
      on you before the day comes wherein there shall be no buying and selling, 
      nor friendship, nor intercession, and it is those who disbelieve that do 
      wrong to themselves.<BR>255. ALLAH - there is no god save HIM, the Living, 
      the Self-Subsisting and All-Sustaining. Slumber seizes HIM not, nor sleep. 
      To HIM belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the 
      earth. Who is he that dare intercede with HIM save by HIS permission ? HE 
      knows what is before them and what is behind them; and they encompass 
      nothing of HIS knowledge, except what HE pleases. HIS knowledge extends 
      over the heavens and the earth; and the care of them wearies HIM not; and 
      HE is the High, the Great. <BR>256. There is no compulsion in religion. 
      Surely the right has become distinct from error; so whosoever refuses to 
      be led by those who transgress and believes in ALLAH, has surely grasped a 
      strong handle which knows no breaking. And ALLAH is All-Hearing. 
      All-Knowing.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
