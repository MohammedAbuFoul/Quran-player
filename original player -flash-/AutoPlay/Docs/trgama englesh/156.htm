    <TD>44. And the inmates of Heaven will call out to the inmates of Hell, 
      saying, `We have indeed found what our Lord promised us to be true. Have 
      you also found what your Lord promised you to be true ?' They shall say, 
      `Yea !' Then a proclaimer shall proclaim between them, saying, `The curse 
      of ALLAH is on the wrongdoers - <BR>45. `Who hinder men from the path of 
      ALLAH and seek to make it crooked and who are disbelievers in the 
      hereafter.' <BR>46. And between the two there shall be a partition, and on 
      the Elevated Places in Heaven there shall be men who will know all by 
      their marks. And they will call out to the people of Heaven, `Peace be on 
      you.' These will not have yet entered it although they will be hoping to 
      do so. <BR>47. And when their eyes are turned towards the companions of 
      the Fire, they will say, `Our Lord, place us not with the wrongdoing 
      people.' <BR>48. And the occupants of the Elevated Places will call out to 
      men, whom they will know by their marks, and say, `Your numbers availed 
      you not, nor your arrogance. <BR>49. `Are these the men about whom you 
      swore that ALLAH would not extend mercy to them ?' To them God will say, 
      `Enter Paradise; no fear shall come upon you, nor shall you grieve.' 
      <BR>50. And the inmates of the Fire will call out to the inmates of 
      Heaven. `Pour out on us some water or some of that which ALLAH has 
      provided for you.' They will say, `Verily, ALLAH has forbidden them both 
      to disbelievers, <BR>51. Those who took their religion for a pastime and a 
      sport, and whom the life of the world has beguiled.' This day, then, shall 
      WE forget them as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs, and as 
      they persisted in denying OUR 
Signs.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
