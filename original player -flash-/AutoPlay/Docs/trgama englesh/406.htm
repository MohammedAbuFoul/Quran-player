    <TD>16. But as for those who disbelieved and rejected Our Signs and the 
      meeting of the Hereafter, these shall be confronted with punishment. 
      <BR>17. So glorify ALLAH when you enter the evening and when you enter the 
      morning - <BR>18. And to HIM belongs all praise in the heavens and the 
      earth - and glorify HIM in the afternoon and when you enter upon the time 
      of the decline of the sun. <BR>19. HE brings forth the living from the 
      dead, and HE brings forth the dead from the living; and HE gives life to 
      the earth after its death. And in like manner shall you be brought forth. 
      <BR>20. And of HIS Signs is that HE created you from dust; then behold, 
      you are men spreading over the earth. <BR>21. And of HIS Signs is that HE 
      has created wives for you from among yourselves that you may find peace of 
      mind in them, and HE has put love and tenderness between you. In that, 
      surely, are Signs for a people who reflect. <BR>22. And of HIS Signs is 
      the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your 
      tongues and colours. In that, surely, are Signs for those who possess 
      knowledge. <BR>23. And of HIS Signs is your sleep by night, and by day, 
      your seeking of HIS bounty. In that, surely, are Signs for a people who 
      would listen. <BR>24. And of HIS Signs is that HE shows you the lightning 
      for fear and hope, and HE sends down water from the sky, and quickens 
      therewith the earth after its death. In that, surely, are Signs for a 
      people who understand.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
