    <TD>123. O ye who believe ! fight such of the disbelievers as are near to 
      you and let them find hardness in you; and know that ALLAH is with the 
      righteous. <BR>124. And whenever a Surah is sent down, there are some of 
      them who say; `Which of you has this Surah increased in faith ?' But as to 
      those who believe, it increases their faith and they rejoice. <BR>125. But 
      as for those in whose hearts is a disease, it adds further uncleanness to 
      their present uncleanness and they die while they are disbelievers. 
      <BR>126. Do they not see that they are tried every year once or twice ? 
      Yet they do not repent, nor do they take heed. <BR>127. And whenever a 
      Surah is sent down, they look at one another, saying, `Does anyone see you 
      ?' Then they turn away. ALLAH has turned away their hearts because they 
      are a people who would not understand. <BR>128. Surely, a Messenger has 
      come unto you from among yourselves; grievous to him is it that you should 
      fall into trouble; he is ardently desirous of your welfare; and to the 
      believers he is specially compassionate and merciful. <BR>129. But if they 
      turn away, say, `ALLAH is sufficient for me. There is no god but HE. In 
      HIM do I put my trust, and HE is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.'
