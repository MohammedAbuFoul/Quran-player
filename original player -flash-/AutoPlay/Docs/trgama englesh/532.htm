    <TD>17. The Lord of the two Easts and the Lord of the two Wests. <BR>18. 
      Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will ye twain, deny ? <BR>19. HE 
      has made the two bodies of water flow. They will one day meet; <BR>20. 
      Between them there is at present a barrier; they cannot encroach one upon 
      the other. <BR>21. Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will ye twain, 
      deny ? <BR>22. There come out from both of them pearls and coral. <BR>23. 
      Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will ye twain, deny ? <BR>24. And 
      HIS are the lofty ships reared aloft on the sea like mountains. <BR>25. 
      Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will ye twain, deny ? <BR>26. All 
      that is on earth will pass away; <BR>27. And there will abide for ever 
      only the Person of thy Lord, Master of Glory and Honour. <BR>28. Which, 
      then, of the favours of your Lord will ye twain, deny ? <BR>29. Of HIM do 
      beg all that are in the heavens and the earth. Everyday HE reveals himself 
      in a different state. <BR>30. Which, then, of the favours of your Lord 
      will ye twain, deny ? <BR>31. Soon shall WE attend to you, O ye two big 
      groups ! <BR>32. Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will ye twain, 
      deny ? <BR>33. O company of jinn and men ! if you have power to break 
      through the confines of the heavens and the earth, then break through 
      them. But you cannot break through save with authority. <BR>34. Which, 
      then, of the favours of your Lord will ye twain, deny ? <BR>35. There 
      shall be sent against you a flame of fire, and molten copper; and you 
      shall not be able to help yourselves. <BR>36. Which, then, of the favours 
      of your Lord will ye twain, deny ? <BR>37. And when the heaven is rent 
      asunder and become red like red hide. <BR>38. Which, then, of the favours 
      of your Lord will ye twain, deny ? <BR>39. On that day neither man nor 
      jinn will be asked about his sin. <BR>40. Which, then, of the favours of 
      your Lord will ye twain, deny
