    <TD>16. And thus have WE sent down the Qur'an as manifest Signs, and 
      surely ALLAH guides whom HE desires. <BR>17. As to those who believe, and 
      the Jews and the Sabians, and the Christians, and the Magians and the 
      idolaters; verily, ALLAH will judge between them on the Day of 
      Resurrection. Surely, ALLAH watches over all things. <BR>18. Hast thou not 
      seen that to ALLAH submits whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in 
      the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains and 
      the trees, and the beasts, and many of mankind ? But there are many who 
      become deserving of punishment. And whomsoever ALLAH disgraces, none can 
      raise him to honour. Verily, ALLAH does what HE pleases. <BR>19. `There 
      are two groups of disputants who dispute concerning their Lord. As for 
      those who disbelieve, garments of fire will be cut out for them; and 
      boiling water will be poured down over their heads, <BR>20. Whereby that 
      which is in their bellies, and their skins too, will be melted; <BR>21. 
      And for their further punishment there will be maces of iron. <BR>22. 
      Whenever in their anguish they will seek to get out of it, they will be 
      driven back into it; and it will be said to them, taste ye the torment of 
      burning !' <BR>23. But ALLAH will cause those who believe and do righteous 
      deeds to enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow. They will be adorned 
      therein with bracelets of gold and with pearls; and their raiment therein 
      will be of silk.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
