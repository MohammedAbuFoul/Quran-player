    <TD>166. And that which befell you, on the day when the two host met, was 
      by ALLAH's command; and this was so that he might cause the believers to 
      be distinguished;<BR>167. And that HE might cause the hypocrites to be 
      distinguished. And it was said to them, `Come ye, fight in the cause of 
      ALLAH and repel the attack of the enemy;' they said, `If we knew how to 
      fight we would surely follow you.' They were that day, nearer to disbelief 
      than belief. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts. And 
      ALLAH knows quite well what they hide. <BR>168. It is these who said to 
      their brethren, while they themselves remained behind, `If they had obeyed 
      us, they would not have been slain.' Say, `Then avert death from 
      yourselves, if you are truthful.' <BR>169. Think not of those, who have 
      been slain in the cause of ALLAH, as dead. Nay, they are living, in the 
      presence of their Lord, and are granted gifts from HIM; <BR>170. Jubilant 
      because that which ALLAH has given them of HIS bounty; and rejoicing for 
      the sake of those who have not yet joined them from behind them, because 
      on them shall come no fear nor shall they grieve. <BR>171. They rejoice at 
      the favour of ALLAH and HIS bounty, and at the fact that ALLAH suffers not 
      the reward of the believers to be lost. <BR>172. Those who answered the 
      call of ALLAH and the Messenger after they had received an injury - such 
      of them as do good and act righteously shall have a great reward; <BR>173. 
      Those to whom men said, `People have mustered against you, therefore fear 
      them,' but this only increased their faith and they said, `Sufficient for 
      us is ALLAH, and an excellent Guardian is 
HE.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
