    <TD>142. The fools among the people will say `What has turned them away 
      from their Qiblah which they followed ?' Say, `To ALLAH belong the East 
      and the West. HE guides whom HE pleases to the right path.' <BR>143. And 
      thus have WE made you an exalted nation, that you may be guardians over 
      the people and the Messenger of ALLAH may be a guardian over you. And WE 
      did not appoint the Qiblah which thou didst follow; except that WE might 
      know him who follows the Messenger of ALLAH from him who turns upon his 
      heels. And this is indeed hard except for those whom ALLAH has guided. And 
      ALLAH would never let your faith go in vain; surely, ALLAH is 
      compassionate and Merciful to the people. <BR>144. Verily, WE see thee 
      turning thy face often to heaven, surely then will we make thee turn to 
      the Qiblah which thou likest. So turn thy face towards the Sacred Mosque; 
      and wherever you may be, turn your faces towards it. And they to whom the 
      Book has been given know that this is the truth from their Lord; and ALLAH 
      is not unmindful of what they do. <BR>145. And even if thou shouldst bring 
      every Sign to those who have been given the Book, they would not follow 
      thy Qiblah nor wouldst thou follow their Qiblah, nor would some of them 
      follow the Qiblah of others. And if thou shouldst follow their desires 
      after the knowledge that has come to thee, then thou shalt surely be of 
      the transgressors.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
