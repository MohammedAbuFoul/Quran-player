    <TD>6. And when mankind are raised up after death, the false deities will 
      be enemies of their worshippers and will deny their worship. <BR>7. And 
      when Our clear Signs are recited unto them, those who disbelieve say of 
      the truth when it comes to them, `This is manifest sorcery.' <BR>8. Do 
      they say, `He has forged it ?' Say, `If I have forged it, you cannot avail 
      me aught against ALLAH. HE knows best what idle talk you indulge in. 
      Sufficient is HE for a Witness between me and you. And HE is the Most 
      Forgiving, the Merciful.' <BR>9. Say, `I am no innovation among 
      Messengers, nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I only 
      follow what is revealed to me; and I am but a plain Warner.' <BR>10. Say, 
      `Tell me, if this Qur'an is from ALLAH and you disbelieve therein, and a 
      witness from among the Children of Israel bears witness to the advent of 
      one like him, and he believed, but you are too proud to believe, how 
      should you fare ?' Verily ALLAH guides not the wrongdoing people. <BR>11. 
      And those who disbelieve say of those who believe, If the Qur'an were any 
      good, they could not have been ahead of us in believing in it.' And since 
      they have not been guided thereby, they will say, `It is an old lie.' 
      <BR>12. And before it there was the Book of Moses, a guide and a mercy; 
      and this is a Book in the Arabic language, fulfilling previous prophecies 
      that it may warn those who do wrong, and give glad tidings to those who do 
      good. <BR>13. Verily, those who say, `Our Lord is ALLAH,' and then are 
      steadfast - no fear shall come upon them, nor shall they grieve. <BR>14. 
      These are the dwellers of the Garden; they shall abide therein - a 
      recompense for what they 
did.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
