    <TD>30. And if WE pleased, WE could show them to thee so that thou 
      shouldst know them by their marks. And thou shalt, surely, recognize them 
      by the tone of their speech. And ALLAH knows your deeds. <BR>31. And WE 
      will, surely, try you, until WE make manifest those among you who strive 
      for the cause of ALLAH and those who are steadfast. And WE will make known 
      the true facts about you. <BR>32. Those, who disbelieve and hinder men 
      from the way of ALLAH and oppose the Messenger after guidance has become 
      manifest to them, shall not harm ALLAH in the least; and HE will make 
      their works fruitless. <BR>33. O ye who believe ! obey ALLAH and obey the 
      Messenger and make not your works vain. <BR>34. Verily, those who 
      disbelieve and hinder people from the way of ALLAH, and then die while 
      they are disbelievers - ALLAH certainly, will not forgive them. <BR>35. So 
      be not slack and sue not for peace, for you will, certainly, have the 
      upper hand. And ALLAH is with you, and HE will not deprive you of the 
      reward of your actions. <BR>36. The life of this world is but a sport and 
      a pastime, and if you believe and be righteous, HE will give you your 
      rewards, and will not ask of you your wealth. <BR>37. Were HE to ask it of 
      you and press you, you would be niggardly, and HE would bring to light 
      your malice. <BR>38. Behold ! You are those who are called upon to spend 
      in the way of ALLAH; but of you there are some who are niggardly. And 
      whoso is niggardly, is niggardly only against his own soul. And ALLAH is 
      Self-Sufficient, and it is you who are needy. And if you turn your backs, 
      HE will bring in your place another people; then they will not be like 
      you.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
