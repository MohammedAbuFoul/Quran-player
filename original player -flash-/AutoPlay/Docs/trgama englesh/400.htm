    <TD>31. And when Our Messengers brought Abraham the tidings, they said, 
      `The tidings is, `We were about to destroy the people of this town; 
      surely, its people are wrongdoers.' <BR>32. He said, `But Lot is there !' 
      They said, `We know very well who is there. We will surely, save him and 
      his family, except his wife, who is of those who remain behind.' <BR>33. 
      And when Our Messengers came to Lot, he was distressed on their account 
      and felt powerless with regard to them. And they said, `Fear not nor 
      grieve, and we have been charged with the divine message: `We will, 
      surely, save thee and thy family except thy wife, who is of those who 
      remain behind, <BR>34. And `We are, surely, going to bring down on the 
      people of this town a punishment from heaven, for they have been 
      rebellious.' <BR>35. And WE have left thereof a clear Sign for a people 
      who would understand. <BR>36. And to Midian WE sent their brother Shu'aib 
      who said, `O my people, worship ALLAH, and be mindful of the Last Day and 
      commit not iniquity in the earth, creating disorder.' <BR>37. But they 
      called him a liar. So a violent earthquake seized them, and in their homes 
      they lay prostrate upon the ground. <BR>38. And WE destroyed Ad and 
      Thamud; and it is evident to you from their dwelling places. And Satan 
      made their deeds appear attractive to them, and thus turned them away from 
      the right path, sagacious though they 
were.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
