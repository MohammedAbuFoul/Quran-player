    <TD>195. So their Lord answered their prayers, saying, `I will suffer not 
      the work of any worker from among you, whether male or female, to be lost. 
      You are from one another. Those, therefore, who have emigrated, and have 
      been driven out of their homes, and have been persecuted for MY cause, and 
      have fought and been slain, I will surely remit from them their evil deeds 
      and will cause them to enter gardens through which streams flow - a reward 
      from ALLAH, and with ALLAH is the best of rewards. <BR>196. Let not the 
      moving about of the disbelievers in the land deceive thee. <BR>197. It is 
      a small and temporary advantage, then Hell shall be their abode. What an 
      evil place of rest. <BR>198. But those who fear their Lord shall have 
      gardens through which streams flow; therein shall they abide - an 
      entertainment from ALLAH. And that which is with ALLAH is still better for 
      the righteous. <BR>199. And surely, among the People of the Book there are 
      some who believe in ALLAH and in what has been sent down to you and in 
      what was sent down to them, humbling themselves before ALLAH. They barter 
      not the Signs of ALLAH for a paltry price. It is these who shall have 
      their reward with their Lord. Surely ALLAH is Swift in settling account. 
      <BR>200. O ye who believe ! be steadfast and strive to excel in 
      steadfastness and be on your guard and fear ALLAH, that you may prosper.
