    <TD>16. When his Lord called him in the holy Valley of Tuwa, <BR>17. And 
      directed him: `Go thou to Pharaoh; he has rebelled,' <BR>18. `And say to 
      him. `Wouldst thou be purified ? <BR>19. `And I will guide thee to thy 
      Lord so that thou mayest fear HIM.' <BR>20. So he showed him the great 
      Sign, <BR>21. But he rejected him and disobeyed; <BR>22. Then he turned 
      away from the Truth, devising schemes; <BR>23. And he gathered his people 
      and proclaimed, <BR>24. Saying, `I am your Lord, the Most High. <BR>25. So 
      ALLAH seized him for the punishment of the Hereafter and the present 
      world. <BR>26. Therein, surely, is a lesson for him who fears his Lord. 
      <BR>27. Are you harder to create or the heaven that ALLAH has made ? 
      <BR>28. HE has raised the height thereof and has made it perfect. <BR>29. 
      And HE has made its night dark; and has brought forth the morn thereof; 
      <BR>30. And the earth, along with it, HE has spread forth. <BR>31. HE has 
      produced therefrom its water and its pasture, <BR>32. And the mountains HE 
      made them firm. <BR>33. All this is a provision for you and for your 
      cattle. <BR>34. But when the great calamity comes, <BR>35. The day when 
      man will call to mind all that he strove for, <BR>36. And Hell will be 
      made manifest to him who sees. <BR>37. Then, as for him who rebels, 
      <BR>38. And prefers the life of this world, <BR>39. The Fire of Hell 
      shall, surely, be his abode. <BR>40. But as for him who fears to stand 
      before his Lord, and restrains his soul from evil desires, <BR>41. The 
      Garden shall, surely, be his abode. <BR>42. They ask thee concerning the 
      Hour: `When will it take place ?' <BR>43. Wherein art thou concerned with 
      the talk of its coming ? <BR>44. The ultimate knowledge of it rests with 
      thy Lord. <BR>45. Thou art only a Warner unto him who fears it. <BR>46. On 
      the day when they see it, it will be as if they had not tarried in the 
      world but an evening or a morn 
thereof.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
