    <TD>31. And when she heard of their sly whisperings, she sent for them and 
      prepared for them a repast, and gave everyone of them a knife and then 
      said to Joseph, `Come forth to them.' And when they saw him they found him 
      to be a person of great dignity and in their amazement cut their hands, 
      and said, ALLAH be glorified ! This is not a human being; this is but a 
      noble angel.' <BR>32. She said, `And this is he whom you blamed me. I did 
      seek to seduce him against his will, but he preserved himself from sin. 
      And now if he do not what I bid him, he shall certainly be imprisoned and 
      become one of the humbled.' <BR>33. Thereupon Joseph prayed: `O my Lord, 
      prison is dearer to me than what they invite me to do; and unless thou 
      turn away their guile from me I shall be inclined towards them and be of 
      the ignorant.' <BR>34. So his Lord heard his prayer, and turned away their 
      guile from him. Verily, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. <BR>35. 
      Then it occurred to them (the chiefs) after they had seen the Signs of his 
      innocence that to preserve their good name, they should imprison him for a 
      time. <BR>36. And with him there entered the prison two young men. One of 
      them said, `I see myself in a dream pressing wine.' And the other said, `I 
      see myself in a dream carrying upon my head bread of which the birds are 
      eating. Inform us of the interpretation thereof; for we see thee to be of 
      the righteous.' <BR>37. He replied, `The food which you are given shall 
      not come to you but I shall inform you of the interpretation thereof 
      before it comes to you. This is on account of what my Lord has taught me. 
      I have renounced the religion of the people who do not believe in ALLAH 
      and who are disbelievers in the 
Hereafter;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
