    <TD>6. And there is no creature that moves on the earth but it is for 
      ALLAH to provide it with sustenance. And HE knows its place of temporary 
      sojourn and its permanent dwelling. All this is recorded in a clear Book. 
      <BR>7. And HE it is who created the heavens and the earth in six periods, 
      - and HIS throne rest on water - that HE might try you which of you is 
      best in conduct. And if you sayest, `You shall surely be raised after 
      death,' those who disbelieve will certainly say, `This is naught but clear 
      deception.' <BR>8. And if WE put off their punishment until a reckoned 
      time, they would certainly say, `What withholds it ?' Now, surely, on the 
      day it shall come unto them, it shall not be averted from them, and that 
      which they used to mock at shall encompass them. <BR>9. And if WE make man 
      taste of mercy from US, and then take it away from him, verily he is 
      despairing, ungrateful. <BR>10. And if after an adversity has touched him, 
      WE let him taste prosperity, he will assuredly say, `Gone are the ills 
      from me.' Lo ! he is exultant, boastful, <BR>11. Save those who are 
      steadfast and do good works. It is they who have forgiveness and a great 
      reward. <BR>12. Perchance the disbelievers vainly hope that thou mayest be 
      persuaded to abandon part of that which has been revealed to thee; and thy 
      bosom may become straitened thereby, because they say, `Wherefore has not 
      a treasure been sent down to him or an angel come with him ? Verily, thou 
      art only a Warner, and ALLAH is Guardian over all 
  things.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
