    <TD>19. Dost thou not see that ALLAH created the heaven and the earth in 
      accordance with the requirements of wisdom ? If HE please, HE can do away 
      with you, and bring a new creation. <BR>20. And that is not at all 
      difficult for ALLAH. <BR>21. They shall all appear before ALLAH; then 
      shall those who were considered weak say to those who were arrogant, 
      `Surely, we were your followers can you not them avail us aught against 
      ALLAH's punishment ?' They will say, `If ALLAH had guided us, we should 
      have, surely, guided you. It is the same for us whether we show impatience 
      or are patient, there is no way of escape for us.' <BR>22. And when the 
      matter is decided, Satan will say, `ALLAH promised you a promise of truth, 
      But I promised you and failed you. I had no power over you, except that I 
      called you and you obeyed me. So blame me not, but blame your ownselves. I 
      cannot succour you nor can you succour me. I have already disclaimed your 
      associating me with ALLAH. For the wrongdoers there shall, surely, be a 
      grievous punishment.' <BR>23. And those who believe and act righteously, 
      will be admitted into Gardens through which streams flow, wherein they 
      will abide by the command of their Lord. Their greeting therein for each 
      other will be, `Peace be on you.' <BR>24. Dost thou not see how ALLAH sets 
      forth a parable of a good word ? It is like a good tree, whose root is 
      firm and whose branches reach into heaven 
?&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
