    <TD>47. And they demand of thee to hasten on the punishment, but ALLAH 
      will never break HIS promise. And, verily, a day with thy Lord is 
      sometimes as a thousand years of your reckoning. <BR>48. And how many a 
      city I have respited, while it was given to wrongdoing. Then I seized it, 
      and unto ME is the return. <BR>49. Say, `O Mankind, I am but a plain 
      Warner to you;' <BR>50. `Those who believe and do good works, for them is 
      forgiveness and an honourable provision; <BR>51. `But those who strive 
      against Our Signs, seeking to frustrate Our purpose - these shall be the 
      inmates of the Fire.' <BR>52. Never did WE send a Messenger or a Prophet 
      before thee, but when he sought to attain his object, Satan put obstacles 
      in the way of what he sought after. But ALLAH removes the obstacles that 
      are placed by Satan. Then ALLAH firmly establishes HIS Signs. And ALLAH is 
      All-Knowing, Wise. <BR>53. This happens that HE may make the obstacles 
      which Satan puts in the way of the Prophet a trial for those in whose 
      hearts is a disease and, those whose hearts are hardened and surely, the 
      wrongdoers are gone far in opposition - <BR>54. And that those to whom 
      knowledge is given may know that it is the truth from thy Lord, so that 
      they may believe therein and their hearts may be humble unto HIM. And, 
      surely, ALLAH guides those who believe to the right path; <BR>55. And 
      those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt about it until the Hour 
      comes suddenly upon them, or there comes to them the punishment of a 
      destructive day.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
