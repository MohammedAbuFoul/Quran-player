    <TD>51. And if WE had sent a wind and they saw their harvest turn yellow, 
      they would, certainly thereafter, begin to deny Our favours. <BR>52. And 
      thou canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou make the deaf to hear 
      the call, when they retreat turning their backs; <BR>53. Nor canst thou 
      guide the blind out of their error. Thou canst make only those to hear who 
      would believe in Our Signs and submit. <BR>54. ALLAH is HE Who created you 
      in a state of weakness, and after weakness gave you strength; then, after 
      strength, caused weakness and old age. HE creates what HE pleases. HE is 
      the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful. <BR>55. And on the day when the 
      appointed Hour shall arrive, the guilty will swear that they tarried not 
      save a brief period - thus are they turned away from the right path. 
      <BR>56. But those, who are given knowledge and faith, will say, `You have 
      indeed tarried according to the Book of ALLAH, till the Day of 
      Resurrection. And this indeed is the Day of Resurrection, but you did not 
      care to know. <BR>57. So on that day their excuses will not avail the 
      wrongdoers; nor will they be allowed to make amends. <BR>58. And, truly, 
      WE have set forth for men in this Qur'an every type of parable, and 
      indeed, if thou bring them a Sign, those who disbelieve will, surely, say, 
      `You are but liars.' <BR>59. Thus does ALLAH seal the hearts of those who 
      have no knowledge. <BR>60. So be thou patient. Surely, the promise of 
      ALLAH is true; and let not those who have no certainty of faith hold thee 
      in light estimation so as to move thee from the stand thou hast 
    taken.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
