    <TD>16. `And now when you have withdrawn from them and from that which 
      they worship beside ALLAH, then seek refuge in the cave; your Lord will 
      unfold to you HIS mercy and will provide for you some easy and comfortable 
      course in this affair of yours.' <BR>17. And thou couldst see the sun, as 
      it rose, move away from their Cave on the right, and when it set, turn 
      away from them on the left; and they were in a spacious hollow thereof. 
      This is among the Signs of ALLAH. He whom ALLAH guides is alone rightly 
      guided; but he whom HE leaves to go astray, for him thou wilt find no 
      helper or guide. <BR>18. Thou mightest deem them awake, whilst they are 
      asleep; and WE shall cause them to turn over to the right and to the left; 
      their dog stretching out its forelegs on the threshold. If thou hadst had 
      a look at them, thou wouldst surely be filled with awe of them. <BR>19. 
      And so WE raised them up that they might question one another. One of them 
      said, `How long have you tarried ?' They said, `We have tarried a day or 
      part of a day.' Others said, `Your Lord knows best the time you have 
      tarried. Now send one of you with these silver coins of yours to the city; 
      and let him see which of the inhabitants has the purest food, and let him 
      bring you provisions thereof. And let him be courteous but let him not 
      inform anyone about you; <BR>20. `For, if they should prevail against you, 
      they would stone you or force you to return to their religion and then you 
      will never prosper.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
