    <TD>137. `This is nothing but the habit of the ancients, <BR>138. `And WE 
      shall not be punished.' <BR>139. So they rejected him, and WE destroyed 
      them. In that, indeed, there is a Sign, but most of these would not 
      believe. <BR>140. And verily thy Lord - HE is the Mighty, the Merciful. 
      <BR>141. The tribe of Thamud also rejected the Messengers, <BR>142. When 
      their brother Salih said to them, will you not guard against evil ?' 
      <BR>143. `Surely, I am unto you a Messenger, faithful to my trust; 
      <BR>144. `So fear ALLAH and obey me; <BR>145. `And I ask of you no reward 
      for it. My reward is only with the Lord of the worlds; <BR>146. `Do you 
      think that you will be left secure amid the things that you have here, 
      <BR>147. `Amid gardens and springs, <BR>148. `And cornfields, and 
      date-palms with heavy spathes near breaking ? <BR>149. `And you hew out 
      houses in the mountains, elated with your greatness; <BR>150. `So fear 
      ALLAH and obey me; <BR>151. `And obey not the bidding of those who exceed 
      the bounds, <BR>152. `Who create disorder in the earth, and do not promote 
      order and security.' <BR>153. They said, `Thou art but one of the 
      bewitched; <BR>154. `Thou art only a mortal like us. So bring a Sign, if 
      thou art of the truthful.' <BR>155. He said, `Here is a she-camel; she has 
      her turn of drinking, and you have your turn of drinking on an appointed 
      day; <BR>156. And touch her not with evil lest there overtake you the 
      punishment of an awful day.' <BR>157. But they hamstrung her; and then 
      they became remorseful. <BR>158. So the punishment overtook them. In that 
      verily there is a Sign, but most of these would not believe. <BR>159. And 
      surely thy Lord - HE is the Mighty, the 
Merciful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
