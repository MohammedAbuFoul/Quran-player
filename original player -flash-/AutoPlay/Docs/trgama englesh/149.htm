    <TD>152. `And approach not the property of the orphan, except in a way 
      which is best, till he attains his maturity. And give full measure and 
      weigh with equity. WE charge not any soul except according to its 
      capacity. And when you speak, observe justice, even if the person 
      concerned be a relative, and fulfill the covenant of ALLAH. That is what 
      HE enjoins upon you, that you may take care.' <BR>153. And say, `This is 
      MY straight path. So follow it; and follow not other ways, lest they lead 
      you away from HIS way. That is what HE enjoins upon you, that you may be 
      able to guard against evils. ' <BR>154. Moreover, WE gave Moses the Book - 
      completing the favour upon him who did good, and an explanation of all 
      necessary things, and a guidance and a mercy - that they might believe in 
      the meeting with their Lord. <BR>155. And this is a Book which WE have 
      sent down; full of blessings. So follow it, and guard against evils that 
      you may be shown mercy, <BR>156. Lest you should say, `The Book was sent 
      down only to two peoples before us, and we were indeed unaware of what 
      they read;' <BR>157. Or lest you should say, `Had the Book been sent down 
      to us, we should surely have been better guided than they.' There has now 
      come to you a clear evidence from your Lord and a guidance and a mercy. 
      Who, then, is more unjust than he who rejects the Signs of ALLAH and turns 
      away from them ? WE will requite those who turns away from OUR Signs with 
      an evil punishment because of their turning 
away.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
