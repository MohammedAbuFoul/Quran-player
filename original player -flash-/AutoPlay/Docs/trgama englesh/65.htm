    <TD>116. As for those who disbelieve, their possessions and their children 
      shall not avail them aught against ALLAH, and these are the inmates of the 
      Fire; therein shall they abide. <BR>117. The likeness of what they spend 
      for the present life is as the likeness of a wind wherein there is intense 
      cold. It smites the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves and 
      destroys it. And ALLAH wronged them not but they wronged themselves. 
      <BR>118. O ye who believe ! take not others than your own people as 
      intimate friends; they will spare no pains to ruin you. They love to see 
      you in trouble. Hatred has already shown itself through the utterances of 
      their mouths and what their breasts hide is greater still. We have made 
      clear to you OUR commandments, if you will only use your understanding. 
      <BR>119. Behold ! you are those who love them, but they love you not. And 
      you believe in the Book, all of it. When they meet you, they say, `We 
      believe;' but when they are alone, they bite their finger tips at you for 
      rage. Say, `Perish in your rage. Surely ALLAH has full knowledge of what 
      is hidden in your breast.' <BR>120. If anything good befalls you, it 
      grieves them; and if an evil afflicts you, they rejoice thereat. But if 
      you be steadfast and righteous, their designs will not harm you at all; 
      surely ALLAH encompasses all that they do. <BR>121. And remember when thou 
      didst go forth early in the morning from thy household, assigning to the 
      believers their positions for battle. And ALLAH is All-Hearing, 
      All-Knowing. &nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
