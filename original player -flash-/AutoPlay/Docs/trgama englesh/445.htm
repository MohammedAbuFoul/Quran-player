    <TD>71. Do they not see that, among the things which Our hands have 
      wrought, WE have created for them cattle of which they are masters ? 
      <BR>72. And WE have subjected the same to them, so that some of them they 
      use for riding, and of the flesh of some they eat. <BR>73. And in them 
      they have other uses, and also drinks. Will they not, then, be grateful ? 
      <BR>74. And they have taken other gods beside ALLAH that they might be 
      helped. <BR>75. But they are not able to help them. On the contrary, they 
      will be brought before God in a body to bear witness against them. <BR>76. 
      So let not their speech grieve thee. Verily, WE know what they conceal and 
      what they proclaim. <BR>77. Does not man see that WE have created him from 
      a mere sperm-drop ? Then lo ! he is an open quarreler ! <BR>78. And he 
      coins similitudes for US and forgets his own creation. He says, `Who can 
      quicken the bones when they are decayed ?' <BR>79. Say, `HE, Who created 
      them the first time, will quicken them; and HE knows well the condition of 
      every created thing. <BR>80. HE Who produces for you fire out of the green 
      tree, and behold, you kindle from it. <BR>81. Has not HE who created the 
      heavens and the earth the power to create the like of them ?' Yea, and HE 
      is, indeed, the Supreme Creator, the All-Knowing. <BR>82. Verily, HIS 
      command, when HE intends a thing, is only that HE says concerning it, 
      `Be,' and it comes into being. <BR>83. So Holy is HE, in Whose hand is the 
      dominion of all things. And to HIM will you be brought 
  back.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
