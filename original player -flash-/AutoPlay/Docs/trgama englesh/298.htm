    <TD>35. And he entered his garden while he was wronging his soul. He said, 
      `I do not think that this will ever perish; <BR>36. `And I do not think 
      the promised Hour will ever come. And even if I am ever brought back to my 
      Lord, I shall, surely, find a better resort than this.' <BR>37. His 
      companion said to him while he was arguing with him, `Dost thou not 
      believe in HIM who created thee first from dust, then fashioned thee into 
      a perfect man ? <BR>38. `But as for me, I believe that ALLAH alone is my 
      Lord, and I will not associate anyone with my Lord; <BR>39. `And why didst 
      thou not say when thou didst enter thy garden, `Only that which ALLAH 
      wills comes to pass. There is no power save in ALLAH,' if thou seest me as 
      less than thyself in riches and offspring; <BR>40. `It may be, my Lord 
      will grant me something better than thy garden, and will send on thy 
      garden a thunderbolt from heaven so that it will become bare slippery 
      ground; <BR>41. `Or its water will dry up so that thou wilt not be able to 
      find it.' <BR>42. And his fruit was totally destroyed, and he began to 
      wring his hands bewailing all that he had spent on it, and it had fallen 
      down on its trellises. And he said, `Would that I had not associated 
      anyone with my Lord ! <BR>43. And he had no party to help him against 
      ALLAH, nor was he able to defend himself. <BR>44. In such a case 
      protection comes only from ALLAH, the True. He is Best in rewarding and 
      Best in respect of the final outcome. <BR>45. And set forth for them the 
      similitude of the life of this world. It is like water which WE send down 
      from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth is mingled with it, and then 
      it becomes dry grass broken into pieces which the winds scatter, and ALLAH 
      has full power over 
everything.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
