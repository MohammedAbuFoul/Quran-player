    <TD>191. And slay these transgressors wherever you meet them and drive 
      them out from where they have driven you out; for persecution is worst 
      than slaying. And fight them not in and near the Sacred Mosque until they 
      fight you therein. But if they fight you, then fight them. Such is the 
      requital for the disbelievers. <BR>192. But if they desist, then surely, 
      ALLAH is Most Forgiving, Merciful.<BR>193. And fight them until there is 
      no persecution, and religion is professed only for ALLAH. But if they 
      desist, then remember that no hostility is allowed except against the 
      wrongdoers. <BR>194. The violation of a Sacred Month may be retaliated in 
      the Sacred Month, and for all sacred things there is the law of 
      retaliation. So whoso transgresses against you, punish him for his 
      transgression to the extent to which he has transgressed against you. And 
      fear ALLAH and know that ALLAH is with those who fear him,<BR>195. And 
      spend in the cause of ALLAH, and cast not yourselves into ruin with your 
      own hands, and do good; surely ALLAH loves those who do good. <BR>196. And 
      complete the pilgrimage and the Umrah for the sake of ALLAH; but if you 
      are kept back, then make whatever offering is easily available; and do not 
      shave your heads until the offering reaches its destination. And whoever 
      among you is sick or has an ailment of the head, should make and expiation 
      either by fasting or alms giving, or a sacrifice. But when you are safe, 
      then he who would avail himself of the Umrah together with the Pilgrimage, 
      should make whatever offering is easily obtainable. But such of you as 
      cannot find an offering should fast three days during the Pilgrimage, and 
      seven when you return home; these are ten complete. This is for him whose 
      family does not reside near the Sacred Mosque. And fear ALLAH and know 
      that ALLAH is severe in punishing.
