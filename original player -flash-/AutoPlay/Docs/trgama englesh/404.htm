    <TD>64. And the life of this world is nothing but a pastime and a sport, 
      and the Home of the Hereafter - that indeed is Life, if they but knew ! 
      <BR>65. And when they go on board a ship, they call on ALLAH, with sincere 
      and single-minded faith in HIM. But when HE brings them safe to land, 
      behold ! they associate partners with HIM again, <BR>66. Being ungrateful 
      for what WE have bestowed on them, and enjoying themselves for a time. But 
      they will soon come to know the consequences of their conduct. <BR>67. Do 
      they not see that WE have made the sanctuary of Mecca secure for them, 
      while people are snatched away from all around them ? Would they then 
      believe in falsehood and deny the favour of ALLAH ? <BR>68. And who is 
      more unjust than he who invents a lie concerning ALLAH, or rejects the 
      truth when it comes to him ? Is there not an abode in Hell for 
      disbelievers ? <BR>69. And as for those who strive to meet US - WE will, 
      surely, guide them in OUR ways. And, verily, ALLAH is with those who do 
      good. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. Alif, Lam, Mim. <BR>2. The Romans have been defeated <BR>3. In the land 
      nearby, and they, after their defeat, will be victorious <BR>4. In a few 
      years - ALLAH's is the dominion before and after that - and on that day 
      the believers will rejoice <BR>5. In ALLAH's help. HE helps whom HE 
      pleases; and HE is the Mighty, the 
Merciful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
