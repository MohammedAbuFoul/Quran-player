    <TD>234. And as for those of you who die and leave wives behind, these 
      (wives) shall wait concerning themselves for four months and ten days. And 
      when they have reached the end of their period, no blame shall be attached 
      to you concerning anything that they do with regard to themselves in a 
      decent manner. And ALLAH is Aware of what you do.<BR>235. And their shall 
      be no blame on you in throwing out a hint regarding proposal of marriage 
      to these women or in keeping the desire hidden in your minds. ALLAH knows 
      that you will think of them in this connection. But make not a contract 
      with them in secret, except that you say a fair word. And resolve not on 
      marriage tie until the prescribed period reaches its end. And know that 
      ALLAH knows what is in your minds; so beware of HIM. And know that ALLAH 
      is Most Forgiving, Forbearing. <BR>236. It shall be no sin for you if you 
      divorce women while you have not touched them, nor settle for them a 
      dowry. But provide for them - the rich man according to his means and the 
      poor man according to his need - a provision in a becoming manner. This is 
      an obligation upon the virtuous.<BR>237. And if you divorce them before 
      you have touched them, but have settled upon them a dowry, then half of 
      what you have settled shall be due from you, unless they remit, or he, in 
      whose hands is the tie of marriage, should remit. And that you should 
      remit is nearer to righteousness. And do not forget to do good to one 
      another. Surely ALLAH sees what you 
do.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
