    <TD>23. Among the believers are men who have been true to the covenant 
      they had made with ALLAH. Some of them have fulfilled their vow, and there 
      are others who wait, and they have not changed in the least. <BR>24. That 
      ALLAH may reward the truthful for their truth, and punish the hypocrites 
      if HE so please, or turn to them in mercy. Verily, ALLAH is Most 
      Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>25. And ALLAH turned back the disbelievers in 
      their rage; they gained no good. And ALLAH sufficed the believers in their 
      fight. ALLAH is Powerful, Mighty. <BR>26. And HE brought those of the 
      People of the Book who had aided them down from their fortresses, and cast 
      terror into their hearts. Some you slew, and some you took captive. 
      <BR>27. And HE made you inherit their land and their houses and their 
      wealth, and also a land on which you have not yet set foot. And ALLAH has 
      power over all things. <BR>28. O Prophet ! say to thy wives, `If you 
      desire the life of this world and its adornment, come then, I will provide 
      for you and send you away in a handsome manner; <BR>29. `But if you desire 
      ALLAH and HIS Messenger and the Home of the Hereafter, then, truly, ALLAH 
      has prepared for those of you, who do good, a great reward.' <BR>30. O 
      wives of the Prophet ! if any of you be guilty of manifestly dishonourable 
      conduct, the punishment will be doubled for her. And that is easy for 
      ALLAH.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
