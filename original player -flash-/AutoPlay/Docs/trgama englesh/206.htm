    <TD>118. And HE has turned with mercy to the three who happened to be left 
      behind until when the earth became too strait for them with all its 
      vastness, and their souls were also straitened for them, and they became 
      convinced that there was no refuge from ALLAH save unto Himself, then HE 
      turned to them with mercy that they might turn to HIM. Surely it is ALLAH 
      who is Oft-Returning with compassion and is Merciful.<BR>119. O ye who 
      believe ! fear ALLAH and be with the truthful. <BR>120. It was not proper 
      for the people of Medina and those around them from among the Arabs of the 
      desert that they should have remained behind the Messenger of ALLAH or 
      that they should have preferred their own lives to his. That is because 
      there afflicts them neither thirst nor fatigue nor hunger in the way of 
      ALLAH, nor do they tread a track which enrages the disbelievers, nor do 
      they gain an advantage over the enemy but there is written down for them a 
      good work on account of it. Surely, ALLAH suffers not the reward of those 
      who do good, to be lost. <BR>121. And they spend not any sum, small or 
      great, nor do they traverse a valley, but it is written down for them, 
      among their good works, that ALLAH may give them the best reward for what 
      they did. <BR>122. It is not possible for the believers to go forth all 
      together. Why, then, does not a party from every section of them go forth 
      that they may become well-versed in religion, and that they may warn their 
      people when they return to them, so that they may guard against 
    evil.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
