    <TD>38. We said. `Go forth hence, all of you. And if there comes to you 
      guidance from ME then whoso shall follow MY guidance, on them shall come 
      no fear nor shall they grieve.' <BR>39. But they who will disbelieve and 
      treat Our signs as lies, these shall be the inmates of the Fire; herein 
      shall they abide. <BR>40. O Children of Israel ! remember MY favours which 
      I bestowed upon you, and fulfill your covenant with ME, I will fulfill MY 
      covenant with you, and ME alone should you fear. <BR>41. And believe in 
      what I have sent which fulfill that which is with you, and be not the 
      first to disbelieve therein, and barter not MY Signs for a paltry price, 
      and take protection in ME alone. <BR>42. And confound not truth with 
      falsehood nor hide the truth knowingly. <BR>43. And observe Prayer and pay 
      the Zakaat, and bow down with those who bow. <BR>44. Do you enjoined 
      others to do what is good and forget your ownselves, while you read the 
      book ? Will you not then understand ? <BR>45. And seek help with patience 
      and prayer, and this indeed is hard except for the humble in spirit, 
      <BR>46. Who know for certain that they will meet their Lord, and to HIM 
      will they return.<BR>47. O Children of Israel ! remember MY favours which 
      I bestowed upon you and that I exalted you above the peoples of the 
      time.<BR>48. And guard yourselves against the day when no soul shall serve 
      as a substitute for another soul at all, nor shall intercession be 
      accepted for it, nor shall ransom be taken from it, nor shall they be 
      helped.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
