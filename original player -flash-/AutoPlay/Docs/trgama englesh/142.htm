    <TD>111. And even if WE send down unto them angels, and the dead speak to 
      them, and WE gather to them all things face to face, they would not 
      believe, unless God enforced HIS Will. But most of them are ignorant. 
      <BR>112. And in the like manner have WE made for every Prophet an enemy, 
      the evil ones from among men and jinn. They suggest one to another gilded 
      speech in order to deceive. And if thy Lord had enforced HIS will, they 
      would not have done it; so leave them alone with that which they 
      fabricate. <BR>113. And ALLAH does this in order that the hearts of those 
      who believe not in the Hereafter may incline thereto and that they may be 
      pleased therewith and that they may continue to earn what they are 
      earning. <BR>114. Shall I seek for a judge other than ALLAH, when HE it is 
      WHO has sent down to you the Book fully explained ? And those to whom WE 
      gave the Book know that it has been sent down from thy Lord with truth; so 
      be thou not of those who doubt. <BR>115. And the word of thy Lord has been 
      fulfilled in truth and justice. None can change HIS words, and HE is the 
      All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. <BR>116. And if thou obey most of those on 
      earth, they will lead thee astray from ALLAH's way. They follow nothing 
      but mere conjecture, and they do nothing but lie. <BR>117. Surely thy Lord 
      knows best those who go astray from HIS way; and HE knows best those who 
      are rightly guided. <BR>118. Eat, then, of that over which the name of 
      ALLAH has been pronounced, if you are believers in HIS 
  Signs.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
