          <TD>41. Verily, WE have revealed to thee the Book comprising all 
            truth for the good of mankind. So whoever follows guidance, follows 
            it for the benefit of his own soul; and whoever goes astray, goes 
            astray only to its detriment. And thou art not a guardian over them. 
            <BR>42. ALLAH takes away the souls of men at the time of their 
            death; and of those also that are not yet dead, during their sleep. 
            Then HE withholds those against which HE has decreed death, and 
            sends back the others till an appointed term. In that, surely, are 
            Signs for a people who reflect. <BR>43. Have they taken intercessors 
            beside ALLAH ? Say, `Even if they have no power over anything and no 
            understanding ? <BR>44. Say, `All intercession rests with ALLAH. To 
            HIM belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And to HIM, 
            then, shall you be brought back.' <BR>45. And when ALLAH alone is 
            mentioned, the hearts of those, who believe not in the Hereafter, 
            shrink with aversion; but when those beside HIM are mentioned, 
            behold ! they begin to rejoice. <BR>46. Say, `O ALLAH ! Originator 
            of the heavens and the earth; Knower of the unseen and the seen; 
            Thou alone wilt judge between Thy servants concerning that in which 
            they differed.' <BR>47. And even if the wrongdoers possessed all 
            that is in the earth, and the like thereof in addition to it, they 
            would, surely, seek to ransom themselves with it to escape from the 
            evil punishment on the Day of Resurrection, but there shall appear 
            unto them from ALLAH that which they had never thought 
        of.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
