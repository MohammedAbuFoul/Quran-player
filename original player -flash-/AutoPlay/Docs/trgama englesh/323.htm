    <TD>11. And how many a township that acted wrongfully have WE utterly 
      destroyed, and raised up after it another people. <BR>12. And when they 
      perceived OUR punishment, lo ! they began to flee from it. <BR>13. 
      Thereupon WE said, `Flee not, but return to the luxuries in which you 
      exulted, and to your dwellings that you might be questioned about your 
      conduct.' <BR>14. They said, `Alas for us, we were indeed wrongdoers !' 
      <BR>15. And this ceased not to be their cry till WE made them like a mown 
      down field, extinct. <BR>16. And WE created not the heaven and the earth 
      and all that is between the two in sport. <BR>17. Had WE wished to find a 
      pastime, WE would, surely, have found it in what is with US, if at all WE 
      were to do such a thing. <BR>18. Nay, WE hurl the truth at falsehood, and 
      it breaks its head, and lo ! it perishes. And woe to you for that which 
      you ascribe to ALLAH. <BR>19. To HIM belongs whosoever is in the heavens 
      and the earth. And those who are in HIS presence do not disdain to worship 
      HIM, nor do they weary of it; <BR>20. They glorify HIM night and day; and 
      they flag not. <BR>21. Have they taken gods from the earth who raise the 
      dead ? <BR>22. If there had been in the heavens and the earth other gods 
      beside ALLAH, then surely both would have gone to ruin. Glorified then be 
      ALLAH, the Lord of the Throne, far above what they attribute to HIM. 
      <BR>23. HE cannot be questioned as to what HE does, but they will be 
      questioned. <BR>24. Have they taken gods besides HIM ? Say, `Bring forth 
      your proof. This Qur'an is a source of honour for those with me, and a 
      source of honour for those before me.' Nay, most of them know not the 
      truth, and so they turn 
away.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
