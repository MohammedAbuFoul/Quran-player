    <TD>39. And warn them of the day of sorrow when the matter will be 
      decided. But now they are in a state of heedlessness, so they do not 
      believe. <BR>40. It is WE who shall inherit the earth and all who are 
      thereon, and to US will they all be returned. <BR>41. And relate the story 
      of Abraham as mentioned in the Book. He was a truthful man and a Prophet. 
      <BR>42. When he said to his father, why dost thou worship that which 
      neither hears nor sees, nor can avail thee aught ? <BR>43. `O my father, 
      there has indeed come to me knowledge such as has not come to thee; so 
      follow me, I will guide thee to a straight path; <BR>44. `O my father, 
      worship not Satan; surely, Satan is a rebel against the Gracious God; 
      <BR>45. `O my father, indeed I fear lest a punishment from the Gracious 
      God seize thee and thou become a friend of Satan.' <BR>46. He replied, 
      `Dost thou turn away from my gods, O Abraham ? If thou desist not, I will 
      surely cut off all relations with thee. Now leave me alone for a while.' 
      <BR>47. Abraham said, `Peace be upon thee. I will ask forgiveness of my 
      Lord for thee. HE is indeed gracious to me; <BR>48. `And I shall keep away 
      from you and from that which you call upon beside ALLAH; and I will pray 
      unto my Lord. Maybe that in praying to my Lord I shall not be 
      disappointed.' <BR>49. So when he had separated himself from them and from 
      that which they worshiped beside ALLAH, WE bestowed upon him Isaac and 
      Jacob and each of them WE made a Prophet. <BR>50. And WE granted them 
      abundantly of OUR mercy; and WE bestowed upon them true and lasting 
      renown. <BR>51. And relate the story of Moses as mentioned in the Book. He 
      was, indeed, a chosen one; and he was a Messenger, a 
  Prophet.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
