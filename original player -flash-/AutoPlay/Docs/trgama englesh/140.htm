    <TD>95. Verily, it is ALLAH Who causes the grain and the date-stones to 
      sprout. HE brings forth the living from the dead, and HE is the Bringer 
      forth of the dead from the living. That is ALLAH; wherefore, then, are you 
      turned back ? <BR>96. HE causes the break of day and HE made the night for 
      rest and the sun and the moon for the reckoning of time. That is the 
      measuring of the Mighty, the Wise. <BR>97. And HE it is Who has made the 
      stars for you that you may follow the right direction with their help amid 
      the darkness of the land and the sea. WE have explained the Signs in 
      detail for a people who possess knowledge. <BR>98. And HE it is Who has 
      produced you from a single soul and there is for you a temporary resort 
      and a permanent abode. WE have explained the Signs in detail for a people 
      who understand. <BR>99. And HE it is Who sends down water from the cloud; 
      And WE bring forth therewith every kind of growth; then WE bring forth 
      with that green foliage wherefrom WE produce clustered grain. And from the 
      date-palm, out of its sheaths comes forth bunches hanging low. And WE 
      produce therewith gardens of grapes, and the olive and the pomegranate - 
      like and unlike. Look at the fruit thereof when it bears fruit, and the 
      ripening thereof. Surely, in this are Signs for a people who believe. 
      <BR>100. And they hold the jinn to be partners with ALLAH, although HE 
      created them; and they falsely ascribe to HIM sons and daughters without 
      any knowledge. Holy is HE and exalted far above what they attribute to 
      HIM, <BR>101. The Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can HE have 
      a son when HE has no consort, and when HE has created everything and has 
      knowledge of all things ?&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
