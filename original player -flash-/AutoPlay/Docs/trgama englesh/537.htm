    <TD>77. This is, indeed, a noble Qur'an, <BR>78. In a well-preserved Book. 
      <BR>79. Which none shall touch except those who are purified. <BR>80. It 
      is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds. <BR>81. Is it this divine 
      discourse that you would reject, <BR>82. And do you make the denial 
      thereof your means of livelihood ? <BR>83. Why, then, when the soul of the 
      dying man reaches the throat, <BR>84. And you are at that moment looking 
      on - <BR>85. And WE are nearer to him than you, but you see not - <BR>86. 
      Why, then, if you are not to be called to account, <BR>87. You cannot 
      bring it back if you are truthful ? <BR>88. Now if he be of those who are 
      near to God, <BR>89. Then for him is comfort and fragrance of happiness 
      and Garden of bliss; <BR>90. And if he be of those of the right hand, 
      <BR>91. Then, `Peace be ever on thee, O thou, of those of the right hand 
      !' <BR>92. But if he be of those who reject the truth and are in error, 
      <BR>93. Then for him will be an entertainment of boiling water, <BR>94. 
      And burning in Hell. <BR>95. Verily, this is the certain truth. <BR>96. So 
      glorify the name of thy Lord, the Incomparably Great. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. Whatever is in the heavens and the earth glorifies ALLAH; and HE is the 
      Mighty, the Wise. <BR>2. HIS is the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth; 
      HE gives life and HE causes death, and HE has power over all things. 
      <BR>3. HE is the First and the Last, and the Manifest and the Hidden, and 
      HE has full knowledge of all 
things.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
