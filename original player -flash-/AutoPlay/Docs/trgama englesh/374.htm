    <TD>160. The people of Lot rejected the Messengers, <BR>161. When their 
      brother Lot said to them, `Will you not fear God ? <BR>162. `Surely, I am 
      unto you a Messenger, faithful to my trust; <BR>163. `So fear ALLAH and 
      obey me; <BR>164. `And I ask of you no reward for it. My reward is only 
      with the Lord of the worlds; <BR>165. `Do you, of all creatures, come to 
      males ? <BR>166. And leave your wives whom your Lord created for you ? 
      Nay, you are a people who transgress all limits.' <BR>167. They said, `If 
      thou desist not, O Lot, thou wilt surely be banished.' <BR>168. He said, 
      `Certainly I hate your conduct.' <BR>169. `My Lord, save me and my family 
      from what they do.' <BR>170. So WE saved him and his family, all of them, 
      <BR>171. Except an old woman, among those who stayed behind. <BR>172. Then 
      we destroyed the others. <BR>173. And WE rained upon them a rain; and evil 
      was the rain that descended upon those who were warned. <BR>174. In that, 
      verily, there is a Sign; but most of these would not believe. <BR>175. And 
      surely thy Lord - HE is the Mighty, the Merciful. <BR>176. The people of 
      the Wood rejected the Messengers, <BR>177. When Shu'aib said to them, 
      `Will you not fear God ? <BR>178. `Surely, I am unto you a Messenger, 
      faithful to my trust. <BR>179. `So fear ALLAH and obey me. <BR>180. `And I 
      ask of you no reward for it. My reward is with the Lord of the worlds; 
      <BR>181. Give full measure, and be not of those who give less, <BR>182. 
      `And weigh with a true balance, <BR>183. `And diminish not unto people 
      their things, nor go about the earth, creating
