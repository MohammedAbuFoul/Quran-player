    <TD>203. And remember ALLAH during the appointed number of days, but whoso 
      hastens to leave in two days, it shall be no sin for him; and whoso stays 
      behind, it shall be no sin for him either. This direction is for him who 
      fears ALLAH. So fear ALLAH and know that you shall all be brought together 
      before HIM. <BR>204. And of men there is he whose talk on this life would 
      please thee, and he calls ALLAH to witness as to that which is in his 
      heart, and yet he is the most contentious of quarrelers. <BR>205. And when 
      he is in authority, he runs about in the land to create disorder in it and 
      destroys the tilth and the progeny of man; and ALLAH loves not disorder. 
      <BR>206. And when it is said to him `Fear ALLAH,' pride incites him to 
      further sin. So Hell shall be his sufficient reward; and surely it is an 
      evil place of rest. <BR>207. And of men there is he who would sell himself 
      to seek the pleasure of ALLAH; and ALLAH is Compassionate to HIS servants. 
      <BR>208. O ye who believe, come into submission all of you and follow not 
      the footsteps of Satan; surely he is your open enemy.<BR>209. But if you 
      slip after the clear Signs that have come to you, then know that ALLAH is 
      Mighty and Wise. <BR>210. What do they wait for but that ALLAH should come 
      to them in the coverings of the clouds with angels, and the matter be 
      decided ? And to ALLAH do all things 
return.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
