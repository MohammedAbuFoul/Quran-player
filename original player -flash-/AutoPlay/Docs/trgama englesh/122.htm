    <TD>83. And when they hear what has been revealed to this Messenger, thou 
      seest their eyes overflow with tears, because of the truth which they have 
      recognized. They say, `Our Lord, we believe, so write us down among the 
      witnesses; <BR>84. `And why should we not believe in ALLAH and in the 
      truth which has come to us, while we earnestly wish that our Lord should 
      include us among the righteous people ?' <BR>85. So ALLAH rewarded them 
      for what they said, with Gardens beneath which streams flow. Therein shall 
      they abide: and that is the reward of those who do good. <BR>86. And those 
      who have disbelieved and rejected Our Signs, these are they who are the 
      inmates of Hell. <BR>87. O ye who believe ! make not unlawful the good 
      things which ALLAH has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Surely 
      ALLAH loves not the transgressors. <BR>88. And eat of that which ALLAH has 
      provided for you of what is lawful and good. And fear ALLAH in Whom you 
      believe. <BR>89. ALLAH will not take you to task for such of your oaths as 
      are vain, but HE will take you to task for breaking the oaths which you 
      take in earnest. The expiation thereof, then, is the feeding of ten poor 
      persons with such average food as you feed your families with, or the 
      clothing of them or the freeing of a slave. But whoso finds not the means 
      shall fast for three days. That is the expiation of your oaths when you 
      have sworn. And keep your oaths. Thus does ALLAH explain to you HIS Signs 
      that you may be grateful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
