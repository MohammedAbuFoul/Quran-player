    <TD>106. Whatever message WE abrogate or cause to be forgotten, WE bring 
      one better than that or the like thereof. Knowest thou not that ALLAH has 
      the power to do all that HE wills ? <BR>107. Knowest thou not that the 
      Kingdom of the Heavens and the earth belongs to ALLAH alone ? And there is 
      no protector or helper for you besides ALLAH.<BR>108. Would you question 
      the Messenger sent to you as Moses was questioned before this ? And 
      whoever takes disbelief in exchange for belief has undoubtedly gone astray 
      from the right path. <BR>109. Many people of the Book wish, out of sheer 
      envy from themselves, that, after you have believed, they could turn you 
      again into disbelievers after the truth has become manifest to them. But 
      forgive and overlook till ALLAH brings HIS decree, surely ALLAH has the 
      power to do all that HE wills. <BR>110. And observe prayer and pay the 
      Zakaat; and whatever good you send on before you for yourselves, you shall 
      find it with ALLAH; surely ALLAH sees all that you do. <BR>111. And they 
      say. `None shall enter Heaven unless he be a Jew or a Christian.' These 
      are their vain desires. Say, `Produce your proof, if you are truthful.' 
      <BR>112. Nay, whosoever submits himself completely to ALLAH and he is the 
      doer of good, shall have his reward from his Lord. No fear shall come on 
      them nor shall they grieve.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
