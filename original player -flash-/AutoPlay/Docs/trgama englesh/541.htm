          <TD>25. Verily, WE sent Our Messengers with manifest Signs and sent 
            down with them the Book and the Balance that people may act with 
            justice; and WE sent down iron, wherein is material for violent 
            warfare and diverse uses for mankind, and that ALLAH may know those 
            who help HIM and HIS Messengers without having seen Him. Surely, 
            ALLAH is Powerful, Mighty. <BR>26. And indeed WE sent Noah and 
            Abraham, and WE placed among their seed Prophethood and the Book. So 
            some of them followed the guidance, but many of them were 
            rebellious. <BR>27. Then WE caused Our Messengers to follow in their 
            footsteps; and WE caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow them, and WE 
            gave him the Gospel. And WE put compassion and mercy in the hearts 
            of those who followed him. And monasticism they invented - WE did 
            not prescribe it for them - for the seeking of ALLAH's pleasure; but 
            they observed it not as it should be observed. Yet WE gave those of 
            them, who believed, their due reward, but many of them are 
            rebellious. <BR>28. O ye who believe ! fear ALLAH and believe in HIS 
            Messenger. HE will give you a double portion of HIS Mercy, and will 
            provide for you a light wherein you will walk, and will grant you 
            forgiveness - verily, ALLAH is Most Forgiving, Merciful - <BR>29. 
            Thus it is that the People of the Book may know that they have no 
            power over anything of the grace of ALLAH; and that grace is 
            entirely in the hands of ALLAH, HE gives it to whomsoever HE 
            pleases. And ALLAH is the Master of immense 
        grace.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
