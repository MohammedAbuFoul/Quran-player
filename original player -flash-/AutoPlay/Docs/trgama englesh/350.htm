    <TD>1. This is a Surah which WE have revealed and the ordinances of which 
      WE have made obligatory; and WE have revealed therein clear commandments 
      that you may take heed. <BR>2. The adulteress and the adulterer - flog 
      each one of them with a hundred stripes. And let not pity for the twain 
      take hold of you in executing the judgment of ALLAH, if you believe in 
      ALLAH and the Last Day. And let a party of the believers witness their 
      punishment. <BR>3. The adulterer cannot have sexual intercourse but with 
      an adulteress or an idolatrous woman, and an adulteress - none can have 
      sexual intercourse with her but an adulterer or an idolatrous man. That 
      indeed is forbidden to the believers. <BR>4. And those who culminate 
      chaste woman but bring not four witnesses - flog them with eighty stripes, 
      and do not admit their evidence ever after, for it is they that are the 
      transgression, <BR>5. Except those who repent thereafter and make amends, 
      for truly ALLAH is Most forgiving, Merciful. <BR>6. And as for those who 
      charge their wives with adultery and have no witnesses except themselves - 
      the evidence of anyone of such people shall suffice if he bears witness 
      four times in the name of ALLAH solemnly affirming that he is of those who 
      speak the truth; <BR>7. And the fifth time that ALLAH's curse be upon him 
      if he be of the liars. <BR>8. But it shall avert the punishment from her 
      if she bears witness four times in the name of ALLAH that he is of the 
      liars; <BR>9. And the fifth time that the wrath of ALLAH be upon her if he 
      has spoken the truth. <BR>10. And were it not for ALLAH's grace and HIS 
      mercy upon you, and that ALLAH is compassionate and Wise, you would have 
      come to grief.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
