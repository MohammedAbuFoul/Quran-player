    <TD>48. And the evil consequences of what they had earned will become 
      apparent to them and that which they used to mock at will encompass them. 
      <BR>49. And when harm touches man, he cries unto US, but when WE bestow on 
      him a favour from US, he says, `This has been given to me on account of my 
      own knowledge.' Nay, it is only a trial; but most of them know not. 
      <BR>50. Those who were before said the same thing, yet all that they 
      earned availed them not. <BR>51. So the evil consequences of what they had 
      earned overtook them; and those who do wrong form among these disbelievers 
      - the evil consequences of what they earned shall overtake them also and 
      they cannot escape. <BR>52. Know they not that ALLAH enlarges the 
      provision for whomsoever HE pleases, and straitens it for whomsoever HE 
      pleases ? Verily, in that are Signs for a people who believe. <BR>53. Say, 
      `O MY servants who have sinned against their souls, despair not of the 
      mercy of ALLAH, surely, ALLAH forgives all sins. Verily, HE is Most 
      forgiving, Ever Merciful; <BR>54. `And turn to your Lord, and submit 
      yourselves to HIM, before there comes unto you the punishment; for then 
      you shall not be helped; <BR>55. And follow the best Teaching that has 
      been revealed to you from your Lord, before the punishment comes upon you 
      suddenly, while you perceive not.' <BR>56. Lest a soul should say, `O woe 
      is me in that I neglected my duty in respect of ALLAH ! Surely, I was 
      among the scoffers.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
