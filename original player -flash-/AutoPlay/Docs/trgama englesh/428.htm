    <TD>1. All praise is due to ALLAH, to Whom belongs whatever is in the 
      heavens and whatever is in the earth. And HIS is All praise in the 
      Hereafter; and HE is the Wise, the All-Aware. <BR>2. He knows whatever 
      goes into the earth and whatever comes forth from it, and whatever 
      descends from the heaven and whatever ascends into it; and HE is Merciful, 
      Most Forgiving. <BR>3. And those who disbelieve say, `The Hour will never 
      come upon us.' Say, `Yea, by my Lord who knows the unseen, it will, 
      surely, come upon you. Not an atom's weight in the heavens or in the earth 
      or anything less than that or greater escapes HIM , but all is recorded in 
      a perspicuous Book, <BR>4. That HE may reward those who believe and do 
      righteous deeds. It is these who will have forgiveness and an honourable 
      provision.' <BR>5. But as to those who strive against Our Signs, seeking 
      to frustrate Our plans, it is they for whom there will be the torment of a 
      painful punishment. <BR>6. And those who are given knowledge see that 
      whatever has been revealed to thee from thy Lord is the truth, and that it 
      guides unto the path of the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. <BR>7. And those who 
      disbelieve say, `Shall we show you a man who will tell you that when you 
      are broken up into pieces, you shall be raised as a new creation 
    ?'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
