    <TD>51. Thou mayest put aside any of them that thou pleasest, and keep 
      with thyself whom thou pleasest; and if thou desirest to take back any of 
      those whom thou hast put aside, there is no blame on thee. That is more 
      likely that their eyes may be cooled, and that they may not grieve, and 
      that they may all be pleased with that which thou hast given them. And 
      ALLAH knows what is in your hearts; and ALLAH is All-Knowing, Forbearing. 
      <BR>52. It is not allowed to thee to marry women after that, nor to change 
      them for other wives even, though their goodness please thee, except any 
      that thy right hand possesses. And ALLAH is Watchful over all things. 
      <BR>53. O ye who believe ! enter not the houses of the Prophet unless 
      leave is granted to you for a meal, not waiting till it is cooked. But 
      enter when you are invited, and when you have had your meal, disperse, 
      without seeking to engage in talk. That causes inconvenience to the 
      Prophet, and he feels shy of asking you to leave, but ALLAH is not shy of 
      saying what is true. And when you ask them - the wives of the Prophet - 
      for anything, ask them from behind a curtain. That is purer for your 
      hearts and their hearts. And it behoves you not to cause inconvenience to 
      the Messenger of ALLAH, nor that you should ever marry his wives after 
      him. That, indeed, is a monstrous thing in the sight of ALLAH. <BR>54. 
      Whether you disclose a thing or conceal it, ALLAH knows all things 
    well.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
