    <TD>51. And WE have, indeed, sent revelation to them continuously, that 
      they may be admonished. <BR>52. Those to whom WE gave the Book before the 
      Qur'an - they believe in it. <BR>53. And when it is recited unto them, 
      they say, `We believe in it. Verily, it is the truth from our Lord. 
      Indeed, even before it we had submitted to its teaching.' <BR>54. These 
      will be given their reward twice, for they have been steadfast, and they 
      repel evil with good, and spend out of what WE have given them. <BR>55. 
      And when they hear idle talk, they turn away from it and say, `For us are 
      our works and for you your works. Peace be upon you. We have no concern 
      with the ignorant.' <BR>56. Surely, thou canst not guide whomsoever thou 
      lovest; but ALLAH guides whomsoever HE pleases; and HE knows best those 
      who would accept guidance. <BR>57. And they say, `If we were to follow the 
      guidance with thee, we should be snatched away from our land.' Say to 
      them, `Have WE not established for them a safe sanctuary, to which are 
      brought the fruits of all things, as a provision from US ?' But most of 
      them know not. <BR>58. And how many a town have WE destroyed which exulted 
      in its life of ease and plenty ! and these are their dwellings which have 
      been but little inhabited after them. And it is WE Who became the 
      inheritors thereof. <BR>59. And thy Lord would never destroy the towns 
      until HE has raised in the mother-town thereof a Messenger, reciting unto 
      them Our Signs; nor would WE destroy the towns unless the people thereof 
      were wrongdoers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
