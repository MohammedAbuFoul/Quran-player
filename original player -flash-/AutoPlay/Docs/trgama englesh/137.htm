    <TD>74. And remember the time when Abraham said to his father, Azar, `Dost 
      thou take idols for gods ? Surely, I see thee and thy people in manifest 
      error.' <BR>75. And thus did we show Abraham the Kingdom of the heavens 
      and the earth that he should have full knowledge and that he might be of 
      those who possess certainty of faith. <BR>76. And when the night darkened 
      upon him, he saw a star. He said, `Can this be my Lord ?' But when it set, 
      he said, I like not those that set.' <BR>77. And when he saw the moon rise 
      with spreading light, he said, `Can this be my lord ?' But when it set, he 
      said, `If my Lord guide me not, I shall surely be of the people who go 
      astray.' <BR>78. And when he saw the sun rise with spreading light, he 
      said, `Can this be my Lord ? This is the greatest.' But when it also set, 
      he said, `O my people ! surely I am quit of that which you associate with 
      God; <BR>79. `I have turned my face toward HIM WHO created the heavens and 
      the earth, being ever inclined to ALLAH, and I am not of those who 
      associate gods with HIM.' <BR>80. And his people argued with him. He said, 
      `Do you argue with me concerning ALLAH when HE has guided me aright ? And 
      I fear not that which you associate with HIM' except that I fear what my 
      Lord wills. My Lord comprehends all things in HIS knowledge. Will you not 
      them be admonished ? <BR>81. And why should I fear that which you 
      associate with ALLAH, when you fear not to associate with ALLAH that for 
      which HE has sent down to you no authority ? Which, then, of the two 
      parties has better title to security, If indeed you know 
  ?&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
