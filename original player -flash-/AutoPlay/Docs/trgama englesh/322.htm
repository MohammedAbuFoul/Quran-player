    <TD>1. Nigh unto men has drawn their reckoning, yet they turn away in 
      heedlessness. <BR>2. There comes not to them any new admonition from their 
      Lord, but they listen to it while they make sport of it. <BR>3. And their 
      hearts are forgetful. And they - the wrongdoers - confer together in 
      secret and say, `Is this man aught but a mortal like yourselves ? Will you 
      then yield to his sorcery with your eyes open ?' <BR>4. In reply to this 
      the Prophet said, ``My Lord knows what is said in the heavens and the 
      earth. And HE is All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.' <BR>5. Nay, they say, 
      `These are but confused dreams; nay, he has forged it himself: nay, he is 
      but a poet. Let him then bring us a Sign just as the former Prophets were 
      sent with Signs.' <BR>6. No township, before them, which WE destroyed, 
      ever believed. Would they then believe ? <BR>7. And WE sent none as 
      Messengers before thee but men to whom WE sent revelations. So ask the 
      people of the reminder, if you know not; <BR>8. Nor did WE give them 
      bodies that ate not food, neither were they to live forever. <BR>9. Then 
      WE fulfilled to them Our promise; and WE saved them and those whom WE 
      pleased; and WE destroyed the transgressors. <BR>10. WE have now sent down 
      to you a Book which makes provision for your eminence; will you not then 
      understand ?&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
