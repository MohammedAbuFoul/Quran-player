    <TD>17. So you slew them not; but it was ALLAH Who slew them. And thou 
      threwest not when thou didst throw, but it was ALLAH Who threw, that HE 
      might overthrow the disbelievers and that HE might confer on the believers 
      a great favour from Himself. Surely, ALLAH is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. 
      <BR>18. That is what happened; And know that ALLAH will weaken the design 
      of the disbelievers. <BR>19. If you, O disbelievers, sort a judgment, then 
      judgment has indeed come to you. And if you desist, it will be better for 
      you; but if you return to mischief, WE too will return to punishment. And 
      your party shall be of no avail to you, however numerous it be, and know 
      that ALLAH is with the believers. <BR>20. O ye who believe ! obey ALLAH 
      and HIS Messenger, and do not turn away from him while you hear his 
      commands. <BR>21. And be not like those who say, `We hear,' but they hear 
      not. <BR>22. Surely, the worst of beasts in the sight of ALLAH are the 
      deaf and the dumb, who have no sense. <BR>23. And if ALLAH had known any 
      good in them, HE would certainly have made them hear. And if HE now makes 
      them hear, they will turn away in aversion. <BR>24. O ye who believe ! 
      respond to ALLAH, and the Messenger when he calls you that he may give you 
      life, and know that ALLAH comes in between a man and his heart, and that 
      HE it is unto Whom you will be gathered. <BR>25. And beware of an 
      affliction which will surely not smite exclusively those among you who 
      have done wrong. And know that ALLAH is Severe in 
  requiting.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
