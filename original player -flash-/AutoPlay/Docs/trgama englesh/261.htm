    <TD>43. They will hurry along in fright, raising up their heads, their 
      gaze not returning to them, and their hearts utterly void. <BR>44. And 
      warn people of the day when the promised chastisement will come upon them, 
      and the wrongdoers will say, Our Lord, grant us respite for a short term, 
      we will respond to thy call and will follow the Messengers.' HE will say, 
      `Did you not swear before this that you would never have a fall ? <BR>45. 
      `And you dwell in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves and it has 
      become plain to you how WE dealt with them; and WE set forth clear 
      parables for you.' <BR>46. And they have tried all their designs; but 
      their designs are with ALLAH. And even though their designs be such as to 
      make the mountains move, they will not succeed. <BR>47. Think not then 
      that ALLAH will ever fail to keep HIS promise to HIS Messengers. Surely, 
      ALLAH is Mighty, Lord of retribution, <BR>48. On the day when this earth 
      will be changed into another earth, and the heavens too; and they will 
      appear before ALLAH, the One, the Most Supreme. <BR>49. And thou wilt see 
      the guilty on that day bound in chains. <BR>50. Their garments will be, as 
      if, of pitch and the fire shall envelop their faces. <BR>51. This will be 
      so that ALLAH may requite each soul for what it has wrought. Surely, ALLAH 
      is swift at reckoning. <BR>52. This is a sufficient admonition for mankind 
      that they may benefit by it and that they may be warned thereby, and that 
      they may know that HE is the only One God and that those possessed of 
      understanding may take heed.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
