    <TD>27. And ALLAH wishes to turn to you in mercy, but those who follow 
      their low desires wish that you should incline wholly towards evil. 
      <BR>28. ALLAH desires to lighten your burden, for man has been created 
      weak. <BR>29. O ye who believe ! devour not your property among yourselves 
      by unlawful means, except that you earn by trade with mutual consent. And 
      kill not your people. Surely, ALLAH is Merciful towards you. <BR>30. And 
      whosoever does that by way of transgression and injustice, WE shall cast 
      him into Fire; and that is easy for ALLAH. <BR>31. If you keep away from 
      the more grievous of the things which are forbidden you, WE will remove 
      from you your minor evils and admit you to a place of great honour. 
      <BR>32. And covet not that whereby ALLAH has made some of you excel 
      others. Men shall have a share of that which they have earned, and women a 
      share of that which they have earned. And ask ALLAH of HIS bounty. Surely, 
      ALLAH has perfect knowledge of all things. <BR>33. And to everyone WE have 
      appointed heirs to what the parents and their relations leave, and also 
      those with whom your oaths have ratified a contract. So give them their 
      portion. Surely, ALLAH watches over all 
things.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
