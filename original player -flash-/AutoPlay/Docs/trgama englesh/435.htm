    <TD>4. And if they reject thee, verily, God's Messengers have been 
      rejected before thee; and unto ALLAH all matters are brought back for 
      decision. <BR>5. O ye men, assuredly the promise of ALLAH is true, so let 
      not the present life deceive you, nor let the Deceiver deceive you with 
      respect to ALLAH. <BR>6. Surely, Satan is an enemy to you; so treat him as 
      an enemy. He calls his followers only that they may become the inmates of 
      the burning Fire. <BR>7. For those who disbelieve there is a severe 
      punishment. And for those who believe and do righteous deeds there is 
      forgiveness and a great reward. <BR>8. Can he, then, to whom the evil of 
      his conduct is made to appear pleasing, so that he looks upon it as good, 
      be like him who believes and does good deeds ? Surely, ALLAH lets go 
      astray whom HE wills and guides whom HE wills. So let not thy soul waste 
      away in sorrow for them. Surely, ALLAH know what they do. <BR>9. And ALLAH 
      is HE who sends the winds which raise the clouds; then do WE drive them to 
      a lifeless tract of land, and quicken therewith the earth after its death. 
      Likewise shall the Resurrection be. <BR>10. Whoso desires honour, let him 
      know that all honour belongs to ALLAH. Unto HIM ascend pure words, and 
      righteous deeds does HE exalt, and those who plan evils - for them is a 
      severe punishment; and the planning of such will perish. <BR>11. And ALLAH 
      created you from dust, then from a sperm drop, then HE made you pairs. And 
      no female conceives, nor does she bring forth a child save with HIS 
      knowledge. And no one is granted long life who is granted long life, nor 
      is anything diminished of his life, but it is all recorded in a Book. That 
      surely is easy for ALLAH.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
