    <TD>18. And WE sent down water from the sky according to a measure, and WE 
      caused it to stay in the earth - and, surely, WE have the power to take it 
      away. <BR>19. And WE produced for you thereby gardens of date-palms and 
      vines; for you therein are abundant fruits; and of them you eat; <BR>20. 
      And a tree which springs forth from Mount Sinai; it produces oil and a 
      source for those who eat. <BR>21. And in the cattle also there is a lesson 
      for you. WE give you to drink of that which is in their bellies and you 
      have in them many other benefits, and of the flesh of some of them you 
      also eat; <BR>22. And on them and on ships you are borne. <BR>23. And WE, 
      certainly, sent Noah to his people, and he said, `O my people, worship 
      ALLAH alone. You have no other god but HIM. Will you not then seek HIS 
      protection ?' <BR>24. And the chiefs of his people, who disbelieved, said, 
      `He is only a mortal like yourselves; he seeks to gain superiority over 
      you. And if ALLAH had so willed, HE could have, surely, sent down angels 
      with him. We have never heard of such a thing among our forefathers; 
      <BR>25. `He is but a man stricken with madness; wait, therefore, 
      concerning him for a while.' <BR>26. Noah said, `O my lord, help me, for 
      they treat me as a liar.' <BR>27. So WE directed him by revelation: `Make 
      the Ark under Our eyes and according to Our revelation. And when Our 
      command comes, and the fountains of the earth gush forth, take thou into 
      it two pairs of every species and thy family, except those of them against 
      whom the word has already gone forth. And address ME not concerning those 
      who have done wrong; they shall, surely, be 
drowned.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
