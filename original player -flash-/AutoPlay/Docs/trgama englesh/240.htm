    <TD>38. `And I have followed the religion of my fathers - Abraham and 
      Isaac and Jacob. It behoves us not to associate anything as partner with 
      ALLAH. This is of ALLAH's grace upon us and upon mankind, but most men are 
      ungrateful; <BR>39. `O my two companions of the prison, are many lords 
      differing among themselves better or ALLAH, the One, the Most Supreme ? 
      <BR>40. You worship nothing besides ALLAH, but mere names that you have 
      named, you and your fathers; ALLAH has sent down no authority for that. 
      The decision rest with ALLAH alone. HE has commanded that you shall not 
      worship anything, save HIM. That is the right religion, but most men know 
      not; <BR>41. `O my two companions of the prison, as for one of you he will 
      pour out wine for his lord to drink; and as for the other, he will be 
      crucified so that the birds will eat from his head. The matter about which 
      you inquired has been decreed.' <BR>42. And of the two he said to him whom 
      he thought to be the one who would be released, `Mention me to thy lord.' 
      But Satan caused him to forget mentioning it to his lord, so he remained 
      in prison for some years. <BR>43. And the King said to his courtiers, `I 
      see in a dream seven fat kine which seven lean ones were eating, and seven 
      green ears of corn and seven others withered. O ye chiefs, explain to me 
      the meaning of my dream if you can interpret 
dreams.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
