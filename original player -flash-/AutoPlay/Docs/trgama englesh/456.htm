    <TD>43. And WE bestowed on him, his family and as many more with them, by 
      way of mercy from US, and as a reminder for men of understanding. <BR>44. 
      And WE commanded him: `Take in thy hand a handful of dry twigs and strike 
      therewith, and incline not towards falsehood.' Indeed, WE found him 
      steadfast. An excellent servant was he. Surely, he was constantly turning 
      to God. <BR>45. And remember Our servants Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, men 
      of might and vision. <BR>46. WE chose them for a special purpose - to 
      remind people of the abode of the Hereafter. <BR>47. And truly, they are 
      in Our sight among the elect and the best. <BR>48. And remember Ishmael 
      and Elisha and Dhu'l-Kifl, they were all the best. <BR>49. This is a 
      reminder. And the righteous will, surely, have an excellent resort - 
      <BR>50. Gardens of Eternity, with their gates thrown open to them, <BR>51. 
      Reclining therein on cushions; they will therein call at pleasure for 
      plenteous fruit and drink; <BR>52. And with them will be chaste women with 
      their eyes downcast, companions of equal age. <BR>53. This is what you are 
      promised for the Day of Reckoning. <BR>54. Verily, this is Our provision 
      which will never be exhausted. <BR>55. This is for the believers. But for 
      the rebellious there is an evil place of return - <BR>56. Hell, wherein 
      they will burn. What an evil resting place ! <BR>57. This is what they 
      will have. So let them taste it - a boiling fluid, and an intensely cold 
      and stinking drink. <BR>58. And various kinds of other torments of a 
      similar nature. <BR>59. It will be said to the leaders of disbelief: `This 
      is an army rushing headlong with you. No welcome for them. They shall burn 
      in the Fire. <BR>60. The followers will say, `Nay, it is you. No welcome 
      for you either. It is you who prepared this for us by leading us astray.' 
      What an evil resting place it is ! <BR>61. They will also say, `Our Lord, 
      whosoever prepared this for us, do thou multiply manifold his punishment 
      in the Fire.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
