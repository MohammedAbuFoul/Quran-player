    <TD>114. Exalted then is ALLAH, the True King. And make no haste to recite 
      the Qur'an ere its revelation is completed unto thee, but only say, `Lord, 
      bestow on me increase of knowledge.' <BR>115. And verily, WE had made a 
      covenant with Adam beforehand, but he forgot, and WE found in him no 
      resolve to disobey US. <BR>116. And remember when WE said to the angels, 
      `Submit to Adam,' and they all submitted. But Iblis did not. He refused to 
      submit. <BR>117. Then WE said, `O Adam, this is an enemy to thee and to 
      thy wife; so let him not drive you both out of the garden, lest thou come 
      to grief; <BR>118. `It is decreed for thee that thou shalt not hunger 
      therein nor shalt thou be naked; <BR>119. `And that thou shalt not thirst 
      therein, nor shall thou be exposed to the sun.' <BR>120. But Satan 
      whispered evil suggestions to him. He said, `O Adam, shall I direct thee 
      to the tree of eternity, and to a kingdom that never decays ?' <BR>121. 
      Then they both ate thereof, so that their nakedness became manifest to 
      them, and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden. 
      And Adam observed not the commandment of his Lord, so his life became 
      miserable. <BR>122. Then his Lord chose him for HIS grace, and turned to 
      him with mercy and guided him. <BR>123. God said, `Go forth both of you 
      from here; some of you will be enemies of others. And if there comes to 
      you guidance from ME, then whoso will follow MY guidance, will not go 
      astray, nor will he come to grief; <BR>124. `But whosoever will turn away 
      from MY remembrance, his will be a straitened life, and on the Day of 
      Resurrection WE shall raise him up blind.' <BR>125. He will say, `My Lord, 
      why hast Thou raised me up blind, while I possessed sight before 
    ?'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
