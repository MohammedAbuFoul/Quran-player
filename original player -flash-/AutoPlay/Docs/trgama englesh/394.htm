    <TD>71. Say, `Tell me, if ALLAH should make the night to continue 
      perpetually over you till the Day of Resurrection, what god is there other 
      than ALLAH who could bring you light ? Will you not then hearken ?' 
      <BR>72. Say, `Tell me, if ALLAH should make the day to continue 
      perpetually over you till the Day of Resurrection, what god is there other 
      than ALLAH who could bring you night wherein you could rest ? Will you not 
      then see ?' <BR>73. And of HIS mercy HE has made for you the night and the 
      day, that you may rest therein and that you may seek of HIS bounty, and 
      that you may be grateful. <BR>74. And on that day HE will call to them and 
      say, `Where are those whom you alleged to be my associates ?' <BR>75. And 
      WE shall take out from every people a witness and WE shall say, `Bring 
      your proof.' Then they will know that the truth belongs to ALLAH alone. 
      And that which they used to forge will all be lost unto them. <BR>76. 
      Verily, Korah was of the people of Moses, but he behaved tyrannically 
      towards them. And WE had given him treasures of hoarded wealth so much 
      that the keys thereof would have weighed down a party of strong men. When 
      his people said to him, `Exult not, surely ALLAH loves not those who 
      exult; <BR>77. `And seek, in that which ALLAH has given thee, the Home of 
      the Hereafter; and neglect not thy lot in this world; and do good to 
      others as ALLAH has done good to thee; And seek not to create mischief in 
      the land. Verily, ALLAH loves not those who create 
  mischief;'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
