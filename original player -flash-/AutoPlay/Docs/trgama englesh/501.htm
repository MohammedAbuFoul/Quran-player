    <TD>23. Hast thou considered the case of him who has taken his own low 
      desire for his god, and whom ALLAH has adjudged as having gone astray on 
      the basis of HIS perfect knowledge, and whose ears and whose heart HE has 
      sealed up, and on whose eyes HE has put a covering. Who, then, will guide 
      him after ALLAH has so decreed concerning him ? Will you not then take 
      heed ? <BR>24. And they say, `There is nothing for us but this our present 
      life; we die and we live; and nothing but time destroys us.' But they have 
      no real knowledge of it; they do nothing but conjecture. <BR>25. And when 
      Our clear Signs are recited unto them, their only contention is that they 
      say, `Bring back our fathers, if you are truthful.' <BR>26. Say, `It is 
      ALLAH Who gives you life, then causes you to die; then HE will gather you 
      together unto the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt. But 
      most men do not know. <BR>27. To ALLAH belongs the Kingdom of the heavens 
      and the earth; and on the day when the Hour shall come, on that day those 
      who follow falsehood shall be the losers. <BR>28. And thou wilt see every 
      people on their knees. Every people will be summoned to its Book, and it 
      shall be said to them, `This day shall you be requited for that which you 
      did. <BR>29. This is Our Book; it speaks against you with truth. WE caused 
      all that you did to be fully recorded.' <BR>30. Now as for those who 
      believed and did righteous deeds, their Lord will admit them into HIS 
      mercy. That is the manifest achievement. <BR>31. But as to those who 
      disbelieved, it will be said to them, `Were not MY Signs recited unto you 
      ? You were arrogant and were a guilty people. <BR>32. `And when it was 
      said to you, `The promise of ALLAH is certainly true, and as to the Hour, 
      there is no doubt about its coming,' you said, `We know not what the Hour 
      is; we think it to be nothing but a conjecture, and we have no certainty 
      concerning it.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
