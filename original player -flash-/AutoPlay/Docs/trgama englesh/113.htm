    <TD>32. On account of this, WE prescribed for the Children of Israel that 
      whosoever killed a person - unless it be for killing a person or for 
      creating disorder in the land - it shall be as if he killed all mankind; 
      and whoso saved a life, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all 
      mankind. And our Messengers came to them with clear Signs, Yet even after 
      that, many of them commit excesses in the land. <BR>33. The only reward of 
      those, who wage war against ALLAH and HIS Messenger and strive to create 
      disorder in the land, is that they be slain or crucified or their hands 
      and feet be cut off on account of their enmity, or they be expelled from 
      the land. That shall be a disgrace for them in this world, and in the 
      Hereafter they shall have a great punishment; <BR>34. Except those who 
      repent before you have them in your power. So know that ALLAH is Most 
      Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>35. O ye who believe ! fear ALLAH and seek the 
      means of approach unto HIM and strive in HIS way that you may prosper. 
      <BR>36. Surely, if those who disbelieve had all that is in the earth and 
      as much over again to ransom themselves therewith from the punishment of 
      the Day of Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them; and they 
      shall have a painful 
punishment.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
