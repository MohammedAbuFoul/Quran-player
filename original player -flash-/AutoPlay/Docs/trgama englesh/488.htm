    <TD>45. And thou wilt see them brought before the Fire, casting down their 
      eyes in humiliation, looking at it with a furtive glance. And those who 
      believe will say, `The losers, indeed, are those who ruin themselves and 
      their families on the Day of Resurrection.' Behold ! the wrongdoers will 
      remain in a lasting punishment. <BR>46. And they have no helpers to help 
      them against ALLAH. And for him, whom ALLAH leaves in error, there is no 
      way of guidance. <BR>47. Hearken ye to your Lord before there comes a day 
      for which there will be no averting contrary to the decree of ALLAH. There 
      will be no refuge for you on that day, nor will there be for you any 
      chance of denial. <BR>48. But if they turn away, WE have not sent thee as 
      a guardian over them. Thy duty is only to convey the Message. And truly 
      when WE cause man to taste of mercy from US, he rejoice therein. But if an 
      evil befalls them because of what their hands have sent forth, then lo ! 
      man is ungrateful. <BR>49. To ALLAH belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and 
      the earth. HE creates what HE pleases. HE bestows daughters upon whom HE 
      pleases and HE bestows sons upon whom HE pleases; <BR>50. Or, HE mixes 
      them, males and females; and HE makes whom HE pleases barren. Surely, HE 
      is All-Knowing, Powerful. <BR>51. And it is not for a man that ALLAH 
      should speak to him except by direct revelation, or from behind a veil, or 
      by sending a messenger to reveal by HIS command what HE pleases. Surely, 
      HE is High, Wise.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
