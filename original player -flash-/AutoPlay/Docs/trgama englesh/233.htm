    <TD>98. He will go before his people on the Day of Resurrection and will 
      lead them into the Fire. And evil indeed will be the watering-place 
      arrived at. <BR>99. And they are pursued by a curse in this life and on 
      the Day of Resurrection. Evil is the gift which will be given them. 
      <BR>100. That is part of the tidings of the ruin cities, WE relate it to 
      thee. Of them some are standing and some have been mowed down like the 
      harvest. <BR>101. And WE did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves, 
      and their gods on whom they called instead of ALLAH were of no avail to 
      them at all when the decree of punishment of thy Lord came to pass; and 
      they added to them naught but perdition. <BR>102. Such is the seizure of 
      thy Lord when HE seizes the cities while they are doing wrong. Surely, HIS 
      seizure is grievous and severe. <BR>103. In that surely is a Sign for him 
      who fears the punishment of the Hereafter. That is a day on which all 
      mankind shall be gathered together and that is the day which shall be 
      witnessed by all. <BR>104. And WE delay it not save for a computed term. 
      <BR>105. On the day it comes, no soul shall speak except by HIS 
      permission; then some of them will be unfortunate and other fortunate. 
      <BR>106. As to the unfortunate, they shall be in the Fire, wherein there 
      will be for them sighing and sobbing, <BR>107. Abiding therein, so long as 
      the heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lord may will. Surely, thy 
      Lord does what HE pleases. <BR>108. But as for the fortunate, they shall 
      be in Heaven, abiding therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure 
      save as thy Lord may wish - a gift that shall not be cut 
  off.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
