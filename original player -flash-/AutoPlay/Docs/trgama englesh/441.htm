    <TD>13. And set forth to them the parable of a people of the town, when 
      the Messengers came to it. <BR>14. When WE sent to them two Messengers 
      they rejected them both; so WE strengthened them by a third; and they 
      said, `Verily, we have been sent to you as Messengers.' <BR>15. They 
      replied, `You are only human beings like us and the Gracious God has not 
      revealed anything. You are only lying.' <BR>16. They said, `Our Lord knows 
      that we are, indeed HIS Messengers to you; <BR>17. `And our duty is only 
      plain delivery of the Message.' <BR>18. The disbelievers said, `Surely, we 
      augur evil fortune from you; if you desist not, we will, certainly, stone 
      you, and a painful punishment will, surely, befall you at our hands.' 
      <BR>19. The Messengers replied, `Your evil fortune is with your ownselves. 
      Do you say this because you have been admonished ? Nay, you are a people 
      transgressing all bounds.' <BR>20. And from the farthest part of the town 
      there came a man running. He said, `O my People, follow the Messengers, 
      <BR>21. `Follow those who ask of you no reward, and who are rightly 
      guided. <BR>22. `And why should I not worship HIM Who has created me, and 
      unto Whom you will be brought back ? <BR>23. `Shall I take others beside 
      HIM as gods ? If the Gracious God should intend me any harm, their 
      intercession will avail me naught, nor can they rescue me. <BR>24. `In 
      that case I should, indeed, be in manifest error. <BR>25. `I believe in 
      your Lord; so listen to me.' <BR>26. It was said to him, Do thou enter 
      Paradise.' He said, `O, would that my people knew, <BR>27. `How graciously 
      my Lord has granted me forgiveness and has made me of the honoured ones
