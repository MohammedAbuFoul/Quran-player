    <TD>78. And WE, indeed, sent Messengers before thee; of them are some whom 
      WE have mentioned to thee ; and of them are some whom WE have not 
      mentioned to thee, and it is not possible for any Messenger to bring a 
      Sign except by the leave of ALLAH. But when ALLAH's decree comes, the 
      matter is decided with justice and then there perish those who utter 
      falsehoods. <BR>79. ALLAH is HE who has made cattle for you, that you may 
      ride on them, and eat of the flesh of some of them - <BR>80. And you 
      derive other benefits from them - and that, by means of them you may 
      satisfy any desire that may be in your breasts. And on them and on ships 
      are you borne. <BR>81. And HE shows you HIS Signs; which, then, of the 
      Signs of ALLAH will you deny ? <BR>82. Have they not traveled in the earth 
      that they might see what was the end of those who were before them ? They 
      were more numerous than these, and mightier in power and left firmer 
      traces in the earth. But all that which they earned was of no avail to 
      them. <BR>83. And when their Messengers came to them with manifest Signs, 
      they exulted in the little knowledge they had. And that at which they 
      mocked encompassed them. <BR>84. And when they saw Our punishment they 
      said, `We believe in ALLAH alone and we reject all that which we used to 
      associate with HIM.' <BR>85. But their faith could not profit them when 
      they saw Our punishment. This is ALLAH's law that has ever been in 
      operation in respect of HIS servants. And thus perished those who 
      disbelieved.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
