    <TD>155. So, for their breaking the covenant, and their denial of the 
      Signs of ALLAH, and their seeking to slay the Prophets unjustly, and their 
      saying: `Our hearts are wrapped up in covers,' - nay, but ALLAH has sealed 
      them because of their disbelief, so they believe not but little - <BR>156. 
      And for their disbelief and for their uttering against Mary a grievous 
      calumny; <BR>157. And for their saying, `We did slay the Messiah, Jesus, 
      son of Mary, the Messenger of ALLAH;' whereas they slew him not, nor did 
      they bring about his death upon the cross, but he was made to appear to 
      them like one crucified; and those who differ therein are certainly in a 
      state of doubt about it; they have no certain knowledge thereof, but only 
      pursue a conjecture; and they did not arrive at a certainty concerning it. 
      <BR>158. On the contrary, ALLAH exalted him to Himself. And ALLAH is 
      Mighty, Wise. <BR>159. And there is none among the People of the Book but 
      will continue to believe in it before his death; and on the Day of 
      Resurrection, he (Jesus) shall be a witness against them. <BR>160. So, 
      because of the transgression of the Jews, WE forbade them pure things 
      which had been allowed to them, and also because of their hindering many 
      men from ALLAH's way, <BR>161. And because of their taking interest 
      although they had been forbidden it, and because of their devouring 
      peoples wealth wrongfully. And WE have prepared for those of them, who 
      disbelieve, a painful punishment. <BR>162. But those among them who are 
      firmly grounded in knowledge, and the believers, believe in what has been 
      sent down to thee and what was sent down before thee, and especially those 
      that observe Prayer and those who pay the Zak?t and those who believe in 
      ALLAH and the Last Day. To these WE will surely give a mighty 
    reward.&nbsp;</TD></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
