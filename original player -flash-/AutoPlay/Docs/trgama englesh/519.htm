    <TD>16. And assuredly, WE have created man and WE know what his mind 
      whispers to him, and WE are nearer to him than even his jugular vein. 
      <BR>17. When the two Recording angels record everything, sitting on his 
      right and on his left; <BR>18. He utters not a word but there is by him a 
      guardian angel ready to record it, <BR>19. And the stupor of death, 
      certainly comes. `this is what thou wast striving to run from.' <BR>20. 
      And the trumpet shall be blown. That will be the Day of Promise. <BR>21. 
      And every soul shall come forth and along with it there will be an angel 
      to bear witness. <BR>22. Then WE shall say, `Thou wast heedless of this; 
      now WE have removed from thee thy veil, and keen is thy sight this day.' 
      <BR>23. And his companion will say, `This is what I have ready of his 
      record.' <BR>24. WE shall say to his two companions, cast ye twain into 
      Hell every disbelieving enemy of truth, <BR>25. Hinderer of good, 
      transgressor, doubter; <BR>26. `Who sets up another god beside ALLAH, so 
      do, ye twain, cast him into the severe torment.' <BR>27. His associate 
      will say, `O Lord, it was not that I caused him to rebel; but he himself 
      was too far gone in error.' <BR>28. ALLAH will say, `Quarrel not in MY 
      presence; I gave you the warning beforehand, <BR>29. `The sentenced passed 
      by ME cannot be changed, and I am not in the least unjust to MY servants.' 
      <BR>30. On that day WE will say to Hell, `Art thou filled up ?' And it 
      will answer, `Are there any more ?' <BR>31. And Heaven will be brought 
      near to the righteous, no longer remote. <BR>32. And it will be said, 
      `This is what was promised to you -to every one who constantly turned to 
      God and was watchful of his actions, <BR>33. `Who feared the Gracious God 
      in private and came to HIM with a penitent heart. <BR>34. `Enter ye 
      therein in peace. This is the Day of Eternity.' <BR>35. They will have 
      therein whatever they desire, and with US is a good deal 
  more.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
