    <TD>62. Behold ! the friends of ALLAH shall certainly have no fear nor 
      shall they grieve - <BR>63. Those who believe and were ever righteous - 
      <BR>64. For them are glad tidings in the present life and also in the 
      Hereafter - there is no changing the words of ALLAH - that indeed is the 
      supreme achievement. <BR>65. And let not their words grieve thee. Surely, 
      all power belongs to ALLAH. HE is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. 
      <BR>66. Behold ! whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth is 
      ALLAH's. Those who call on others than ALLAH do not really follow these 
      associated-gods; they only follow conjecture, and they only make guesses. 
      <BR>67. HE it is Who has made for you the night dark that you may rest 
      therein, and the day full of light that you may pursue your occupations. 
      Surely, therein are Signs for a people who listen to the divine Message. 
      <BR>68. They say, `ALLAH has taken unto HIM a son,' Holy is HE ! HE is 
      Self-Sufficient. To HIM belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is 
      in the earth. You have no authority for this. What ! do you say concerning 
      ALLAH what you know not ? <BR>69. Say, `Those who invent a lie against 
      ALLAH shall not prosper.' <BR>70. They will have some enjoyment in this 
      world. Then to US is their return. Then WE shall make them taste a severe 
      torment, because they continued to 
disbelieve.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
