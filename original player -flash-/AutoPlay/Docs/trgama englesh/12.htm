    <TD>77. Do they not know that ALLAH knows what they keep secret and what 
      they make known ? <BR>78. And some of them are illiterate, they know not 
      the book but their own false notions, and they do nothing but conjecture. 
      <BR>79. Woe, therefore, to those who write the Book with their own hands 
      and then say, `This is from ALLAH,' That they may take it for a paltry 
      price. Woe, then, to them for what their hands have written, and woe to 
      them for what they earn. <BR>80. And they say, `The fire shall not touch 
      us except for a small number of days,' Say, `Have you taken a promise from 
      ALLAH ? Then, ALLAH will never break HIS promise. Or, do you say of ALLAH 
      what you know not. <BR>81. Aye ! whoso does evil and is encompassed by his 
      sins -those are the inmates of the Fire; therein shall they abide. <BR>82. 
      But they who believe and do good works - those are the dwellers of Heaven; 
      therein shall they abide. <BR>83. And remember the time when WE took a 
      covenant from the Children of Israel: `You shall worship none but ALLAH 
      and be kind to parents and to the kindred and orphans and the poor, and 
      speak to men kindly and observe prayer, and pay the Zakat.' then you 
      turned away in aversion, except a few of 
you.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
