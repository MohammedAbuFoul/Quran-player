    <TD>88. The chief men of his people who were arrogant said, `Assuredly we 
      will drive thee out, O Shu'aib, and the believers that are with thee from 
      our town, or you shall return to our religion.' He said, `Even though we 
      be unwilling ? <BR>89. If we return to your religion after ALLAH has saved 
      us therefrom, we would indeed admit that we had been forging a lie against 
      ALLAH. And it behoves us not to return thereto except that ALLAH, our 
      Lord, should so will. Our Lord comprehends all things in HIS knowledge. In 
      ALLAH have we put our trust. So, Our Lord, decide Thou between us and 
      between our people with truth and Thou art the Best of those who decide. 
      <BR>90. And the chief men of his people, who disbelieved, said, `If you 
      follow Shu'aib, you shall then certainly be of the losers.' <BR>91. So the 
      earthquake seized them and in their homes they lay prostrate upon the 
      ground; <BR>92. Those who accused Shu'aib of lying became as if they had 
      never dwelt therein. Those who accused Shu'aib of lying - it was they who 
      were the losers. <BR>93. Then he turned away from them and said, `O my 
      people, indeed I delivered to you the messages of my Lord and gave you 
      sincere counsel, How then should I sorrow for a disbelieving people.' 
      <BR>94. And never did WE send a Prophet to any town but WE did seize its 
      people with adversity and suffering, that they might humble themselves. 
      <BR>95. Then WE changed their evil condition to good until they grew in 
      affluence and numbers and said, `Suffering and happiness betided our 
      fathers also, what if they befell us.' Then WE seized them suddenly, while 
      they perceive not.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
