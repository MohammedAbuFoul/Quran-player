    <TD>59. The Hour of punishment will, surely, come; there is no doubt about 
      it; yet most men believe not. <BR>60. And your Lord says, `Pray unto ME; I 
      will answer your prayer. But those who are too proud to worship ME will, 
      surely, enter Hell, despised.' <BR>61. ALLAH is HE who has made the night 
      for you that you may rest therein, and the day to enable you to see. 
      Verily, ALLAH is Bountiful to mankind, yet most men are ungrateful. 
      <BR>62. Such is ALLAH, your Lord, the Creator of all things. There is no 
      god but HE. How then, are, you turned away ? <BR>63. Thus, indeed, are 
      turned away those who deny the Signs of ALLAH. <BR>64. ALLAH is HE who has 
      made for you the earth a resting-place and the heaven a structure for 
      protection, and has given you shapes and made your shapes perfect, and has 
      provided you with pure things. Such is ALLAH, your Lord. So blessed is 
      ALLAH, the Lord of the worlds. <BR>65. HE is the Living God. There is no 
      god but HE. So pray unto HIM, devoting your worship wholly and sincerely 
      to HIM. All praise belongs to ALLAH, the Lord of the worlds. <BR>66. Say, 
      I have been forbidden to worship those whom you call upon beside ALLAH 
      since there have come clear proofs unto me from MY Lord; and I have been 
      commanded to submit myself solely to the Lord of the 
  worlds.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
