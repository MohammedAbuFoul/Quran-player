    <TD>197. The months of the Pilgrimage are well known; so whoever 
      determines to perform the Pilgrimage in these months should remember that 
      there is to be no foul talk, nor any transgression, nor any quarreling 
      during the Pilgrimage. And whatever good you do, ALLAH knows it. And 
      furnish yourselves with necessary provisions for your journey and surely, 
      the best provision is righteousness. And fear ME alone, O men of 
      understanding.<BR>198. It is no sin for you that you seek the bounty of 
      your Lord. But when you pour forth from Arafat, remember ALLAH at Mash'ar 
      al-Haraam, and remember HIM as HE has guided you; although before this you 
      were of those gone astray.<BR>199. Then pour forth from where the people 
      pour forth, and seek forgiveness from ALLAH; surely ALLAH is most 
      forgiving, Merciful. <BR>200. And when you have performed the acts of 
      worship prescribed for you, celebrate the praises of ALLAH as you used to 
      celebrate the praises of your fathers, or even with greater devotion. And 
      of men there are some who say `Our Lord grant us good things in this 
      world;' and such a one shall have no share in the hereafter. <BR>201. And 
      of them there are some who say, `Our Lord grant us good in this world as 
      well as good in the world to come, and save us from the torment of the 
      fire. <BR>202. For these their shall be a goodly share because of what 
      they have earned. And ALLAH is swift at 
reckoning.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
