    <TD>154. Then after the sorrow HE sent down peace on you - a slumber that 
      overcame a party of you - while the other part was anxious concerning 
      their ownselves. They entertain about ALLAH wrong thoughts of ignorance. 
      They said, `Have we any part in the affair ?' Say, `Verily the affair 
      wholly belongs to ALLAH.' They hide in their minds what they disclose not 
      to thee. They say, `If we had any part in the determination of the 
      affairs, we should not have been killed here.' Say, `If you had remained 
      in your homes, surely those on whom fighting had been enjoined would have 
      gone forth to their death-beds that ALLAH might fulfill HIS decree and 
      that HE might test what is in your breasts and that HE might purge what 
      was in your hearts. And ALLAH knows well what is in your breasts;<BR>155. 
      Those of you who turned their backs on the day when the two host met, 
      surely it was Satan who sought to make them stumble because of certain 
      doings of theirs. But certainly ALLAH has already pardoned them. Verily 
      ALLAH is Most Forgiving, Forbearing. <BR>156. O ye who believe ! be not 
      like those who have disbelieved, and who say of their brethren when they 
      travel in the land or go forth to war: `Had they been with us, they would 
      not have died or been slain.' They say this that ALLAH may make it a cause 
      of regret in their hearts. And ALLAH gives life and causes death and ALLAH 
      is Mindful of what you do. <BR>157. And if you are slain in the cause of 
      ALLAH or you die, surely, forgiveness from ALLAH and mercy are better than 
      what they hoard.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
