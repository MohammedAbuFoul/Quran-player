    <TD>28. And if thou has to turn away from them while seeking thy Lord's 
      mercy for which thou hopest, even then speak to them a kind word. <BR>29. 
      And keep not thy hand chained to thy neck out of miserliness nor stretch 
      it forth to its utmost limit out of extravagance, lest thou sit down 
      blamed and exhausted. <BR>30. Surely, thy Lord enlarges HIS provision for 
      whom HE pleases, and straitens it for whom HE pleases. Verily, HE knows 
      and sees HIS servants full well. <BR>31. And slay not your children for 
      fear of poverty. It is WE Who provide for them and for you. Surely, the 
      slaying of them is a grievous sin. <BR>32. And go not nigh unto adultery, 
      surely, it is a manifest indecency and an evil way. <BR>33. And slay not 
      the soul, the slaying of which ALLAH has forbidden, save for a just cause. 
      And whoso is slain wrongfully, WE have surely given his heir authority to 
      demand retribution but let him not exceed the prescribed bounds in 
      slaying; for therein he will be supported by law. <BR>34. And come not 
      near the property of the orphan, except in the best way, until he attains 
      his maturity and fulfill the covenant; for the covenant shall be 
      questioned about. <BR>35. And give full measure when you measure and weigh 
      with a right balance; that is best and most commendable in the end. 
      <BR>36. And follow not that of which thou hast no knowledge. Verily, the 
      ear and the eye and the heart - all these shall be called to account. 
      <BR>37. And walk not in the earth haughtily, for thou canst not thus rend 
      the earth, nor canst thou reach the mountains in height. <BR>38. The evil 
      of all these is hateful in the sight of thy 
Lord.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
