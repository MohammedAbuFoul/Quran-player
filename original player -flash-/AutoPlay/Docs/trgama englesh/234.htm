    <TD>109. So be thou not in doubt, O reader, concerning that which these 
      people worship. They only worship as their fathers worshiped before, and 
      WE shall surely pay them in full their portion undiminished. <BR>110. And 
      WE certainly gave Moses the Book, but differences were created therein; 
      and had it not been for a word already gone forth from thy Lord, surely 
      the matter would have been decided between them long before, and now these 
      people are in a disquieting doubt concerning it. <BR>111. Thy Lord will 
      certainly repay them in full, according to their works. HE is surely 
      Well-Aware of all that they do. <BR>112. So stand thou upright, as thou 
      hast been commanded, and also those who have turned to ALLAH with thee; 
      and exceed ye not the bounds, for surely, HE sees what you do. <BR>113. 
      And incline not toward those who do wrong, lest the Fire touch you; and 
      you will have no friend other than ALLAH, nor shall you be helped. 
      <BR>114. And observe Prayer at the two ends of the day, and in some hours 
      of the night. Surely, good works drive away evil ones. This is a reminder 
      for those who would remember. <BR>115. And be thou steadfast; surely, 
      ALLAH suffers not the reward of the righteous to perish. <BR>116. Why, 
      then, were there not among the generations before you persons possessed of 
      understanding, who would have forbidden corruption in the earth, except a 
      few among them whom WE saved ? But the wrongdoers pursued the enjoyment of 
      the good things which they were given in plenty, and they became guilty. 
      <BR>117. And thy Lord would not destroy the cities unjustly while the 
      people thereof were righteous.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
