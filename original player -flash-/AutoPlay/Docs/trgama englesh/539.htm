    <TD>12. And think of the day when thou wilt see the believing men and the 
      believing women, their light running before them and on their right hands, 
      and angels will say to them, `Glad tidings for you this day of Gardens 
      through which streams flow, wherein you will abide. That is the supreme 
      triumph.' <BR>13. That is the day when the hypocritical men and the 
      hypocritical women will say to those who believe, `Wait for us a while 
      that we may borrow some of your light,' it will be said to them, `Go back 
      if you can, and seek for light.' Then there will be set up between them a 
      wall with a door in it. The inside of it will be all mercy and outside of 
      it, in front, will be torment. <BR>14. The hypocrites will call out to 
      believers saying, `Were we not with you ?' The believers will answer, 
      `Yea, but you let yourselves fall into temptation and you hesitated and 
      doubted and your vain desires deceived you till the decree of ALLAH came 
      to pass. And the deceiver deceived you concerning ALLAH. <BR>15. `So this 
      day no ransom shall be accepted from you, nor from those who disbelieved. 
      Your final abode is the Fire; that is your comrade; and an evil 
      destination it is.' <BR>16. Has not the time yet arrived for those who 
      believe that their hearts should feel humbled at the remembrance of ALLAH 
      and at the truth which has come down to them, and that they should not 
      become like those who were given the Book before them, but because the 
      period of the bestowal of ALLAH's grace upon them was prolonged for them, 
      their hearts became hardened, and many of them became rebellious ? <BR>17. 
      Know, then, that ALLAH quickens the earth after its death. WE have made 
      the Signs manifest to you, that you may understand. <BR>18. Surely, the 
      men who give alms and the women who give alms, and those who lend to ALLAH 
      a goodly loan - it will be increased manifold for them, and theirs will 
      also be a honourable reward
