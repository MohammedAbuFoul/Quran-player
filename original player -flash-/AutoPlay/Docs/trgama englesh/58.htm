    <TD>62. This certainly is the true account. There is none worthy of 
      worship save ALLAH; and surely, it is ALLAH Who is the Mighty, the Wise. 
      <BR>63. But if they turn away, then remember that ALLAH fully knows the 
      mischief-makers. <BR>64. Say, `O people of the Book ! come to a word equal 
      to us and you - that we worship none but ALLAH, and that we associate no 
      partner with HIM, and that some of us take not others for Lords beside 
      ALLAH.' But if they turn away, then say `Bear witness that we have 
      submitted to God.' <BR>65. O People of the Book ! Why do you dispute 
      concerning Abraham, When the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed till 
      after him ? Will you not understand. <BR>66. Behold ! you are those who 
      disputed about that whereof you had some knowledge. Why then do you now 
      dispute about that whereof you have no knowledge at all ? ALLAH knows and 
      you know not. <BR>67. Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian but he was 
      ever inclined to God and obedient to HIM, and he was not of those who 
      associate gods with ALLAH. <BR>68. Surely, the nearest of men to Abraham 
      are those who followed him and this prophet and those who believe in him, 
      and ALLAH is the Friend of the believers. <BR>69. A party of the People of 
      the Book would fain lead you astray; but they lead astray none except 
      themselves, only they perceive not. <BR>70. O People of the Book ! Why do 
      you deny the signs of ALLAH, while you are witnesses thereof 
  ?&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
