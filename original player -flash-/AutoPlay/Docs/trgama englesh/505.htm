    <TD>21. And remember the brother of Ad, when he warned his people among 
      the sand-hills - and warners there have been before him and after him - 
      saying, `Worship none but ALLAH. I fear for you the punishment of a great 
      day.' <BR>22. They said, `Hast thou come to us to turn us away from our 
      gods ? Bring us then that with which thou dost threaten us, if, indeed, 
      thou art of the truthful.' <BR>23. He said, `The knowledge thereof is only 
      with ALLAH. And I convey to you what I have been sent with, but I see that 
      you are a very ignorant people.' <BR>24. Then, when they saw the 
      punishment coming towards their valleys in the form of a cloud, they said, 
      `This is a cloud which will give us rain.' We said, `Nay, but it is that 
      which you sought to hasten - a wind wherein is a grievous punishment; 
      <BR>25. `It will destroy everything by the command of its Lord.' By 
      morning there was nothing to be seen, except their dwellings. Thus do WE 
      requite the guilty people. <BR>26. And WE had established them in that 
      wherein WE have not established you; and WE gave them ears and eyes and 
      hearts. But their ears and their eyes and their hearts availed them 
      naught, since they denied the Signs of ALLAH; and that at which they used 
      to mock encompassed them. <BR>27. And, certainly, WE destroyed townships 
      round about you and WE have explained Our Signs in various ways, that they 
      might turn to Us. <BR>28. Why, then, did not those help them whom they had 
      taken for gods beside ALLAH that they might bring them near to Him ? Nay, 
      they were lost to them. That was the consequence of their lie, and of what 
      they fabricated.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
