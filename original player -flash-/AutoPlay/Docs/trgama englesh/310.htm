    <TD>65. HE is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is 
      between the two. Serve HIM, therefore, and be steadfast in HIS service. 
      Dost thou know anyone equal to HIM ? <BR>66. And says man, `What ! when I 
      am dead, shall I be brought forth alive ?' <BR>67. Does not man remember 
      that WE created him before, when he was nothing ? <BR>68. And, by thy 
      Lord, WE shall assuredly gather them together, and the satans too; then 
      shall WE bring them on their knees around Hell. <BR>69. Then shall WE 
      certainly pick out, from every group, those of them who were most stubborn 
      in rebellion against the Gracious God. <BR>70. And surely, WE know best 
      those deserving to be burnt therein. <BR>71. And there is not one of you 
      but will come to it. This is an absolute decree of thy Lord. <BR>72. And 
      WE shall save the righteous, and shall leave the wrongdoers therein, on 
      their knees. <BR>73. And when OUR manifest Signs are recited unto them, 
      the disbelievers say to the believers, `Tell us, which of the two parties 
      is better in respect of position and is more impressive in respect of 
      companions ?' <BR>74. And how many a generation have WE destroyed before 
      them, who were better off than these in wealth and better in outward show. 
      <BR>75. Say, `The Gracious God grants those, who are in error, respite for 
      a time until, when they will see that with which they are threatened - 
      whether it be punishment or the final Hour - they will realize who is 
      worse in respect of position and weaker in forces.' <BR>76. And ALLAH 
      increases in guidance those who follow guidance. And the good works that 
      endure are best in the sight of thy Lord in respect of reward and in 
      respect of the ultimate 
end.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
