    <TD>105. `It is not right that I should say anything of God except the 
      truth. I have come to you with a clear Sign from your Lord; therefore, let 
      the children of Israel go with me.' <BR>106. Pharaoh replied, `If thou 
      hast indeed come with a Sign, then produce it, if thou art truthful.' 
      <BR>107. So he flung his rod and behold ! it was a serpent plainly 
      visible. <BR>108. And he drew forth his hand, and lo ! it appeared white 
      to the beholders. <BR>109. The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said, `This is 
      most surely a skillful sorcerer; <BR>110. `He desires to turn you out from 
      your land. Now what do you advise ?' <BR>111. They said, `Put him off and 
      his brother awhile, and send into the city summoners, <BR>112. `Who should 
      bring to thee every skillful sorcerer.' <BR>113. And the sorcerers came to 
      Pharaoh and said: `We shall, of course, have a reward, if we prevail,' 
      <BR>114. He said, `Yes, and you shall also be of those who are placed near 
      to me.' <BR>115. They said, `O Moses, wilt thou throw first or shall we be 
      the first throwers ?' <BR>116. He replied, `Throw ye.' And when they 
      threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people and struck them with awe and 
      produced a mighty magic. <BR>117. And WE revealed to Moses: `Throw thy 
      rod,' and lo ! it swallowed up whatever they feigned. <BR>118. So was the 
      truth established and whatever they did, proved vain. <BR>119. Thus were 
      they vanquished there and they retired humiliated. <BR>120. And the 
      sorcerers were impelled to fall down 
prostrate.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
