    <TD>1. By the Fig and the Olive, <BR>2. And Mount Sinai, <BR>3. And this 
      Town of Security, <BR>4. Surely, WE have created man in the best make; 
      <BR>5. Then, when he does evil deeds, WE degrade him as the lowest of the 
      low, <BR>6. Save those who believe and do good works; so for them is an 
      unfailing reward. <BR>7. Then what is there to give the lie to thee after 
      this, with regard to the judgment ? <BR>8. Is not ALLAH the Most Just of 
      judges ? <BR>&nbsp;
      <HR width="90%" color=#000000 SIZE=3>
      1. Proclaim thou in the name of thy Lord Who created, <BR>2. Created man 
      from a clot of blood. <BR>3. Proclaim ! and thy Lord is the Most 
      Bounteous; <BR>4. Who taught by the pen, <BR>5. Taught man what he knew 
      not. <BR>6. Nay ! man, indeed, transgresses, <BR>7. Because he thinks 
      himself to be independent. <BR>8. Surely, unto thy Lord is the return. 
      <BR>9. Has thou seen him who forbids <BR>10. A servant of Ours when he 
      prays ? <BR>11. Tell me if Our servant follows the guidance, <BR>12. Or 
      enjoins righteousness. <BR>13. And tell me if the forbidder rejects the 
      Truth and turns his back on it. How shall he fare ? <BR>14. Does he not 
      know that ALLAH sees all ? <BR>15. Nay, if he desist not, WE will 
      assuredly, seize and drag him by the forelock - <BR>16. A forelock, lying, 
      sinful. <BR>17. Then let him call his associates. <BR>18. WE, too, will 
      call Our angels of punishment. <BR>19. Nay, yield thou not to him, but 
      prostrate thyself and draw near to 
ALLAH.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
