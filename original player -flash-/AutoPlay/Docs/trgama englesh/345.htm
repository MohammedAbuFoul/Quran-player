    <TD>43. No people can go ahead of their appointed time, nor can they 
      remain behind it. <BR>44. Then WE sent Our Messengers one after the other. 
      Every time there came to a people their Messenger, they treated him as a 
      liar. So WE made them follow one another to destruction and WE made them 
      mere tales of the past. Cursed, then, be the people who believe not ! 
      <BR>45. Then WE sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our Signs and a 
      clear authority, <BR>46. To Pharaoh and his chiefs; but they behaved 
      arrogantly and they were a haughty people. <BR>47. And they said, `Shall 
      we believe in two mortals like ourselves while their people are our slaves 
      ?' <BR>48. So they called them liars, and became a ruined people. <BR>49. 
      And WE gave Moses the Book, that they might be guided. <BR>50. And WE made 
      the son of Mary and his mother a Sign, and gave them shelter on an 
      elevated land of green valleys and springs of running water. <BR>51. O ye 
      Messengers, eat of the pure things and do good works. Verily, I am 
      Well-Aware of what you do. <BR>52. And know that this community of yours 
      is one community, and I am your Lord. So take ME as your Protector. 
      <BR>53. But the people have cut up their affair among themselves, forming 
      themselves into parties, each group rejoicing in what is with them. 
      <BR>54. So leave them in their confusion for a time. <BR>55. Do they image 
      that because WE bestow upon them wealth and children, <BR>56. WE hasten to 
      do them good ? Nay, but they understand not. <BR>57. Verily, those who 
      tremble with fear of their Lord, <BR>58. And those who believe in the 
      Signs of their Lord, <BR>59. And those who ascribe not partners to their 
      Lord,&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
