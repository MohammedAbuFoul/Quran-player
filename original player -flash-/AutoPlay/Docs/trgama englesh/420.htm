    <TD>16. Say, `Flight shall not avail you if you flee from death or 
      slaughter; and even then you will not be allowed to enjoy yourselves but a 
      little.' <BR>17. Say, `Who is it that can save you from ALLAH if it be HIS 
      wish to do you harm, or can deprive you of it, if it be HIS wish to show 
      you mercy ?' And they will not find for themselves any friend nor helper 
      other than ALLAH. <BR>18. Verily, ALLAH knows well those among you who 
      hinder others from fighting and those who say to their brethren, `Come and 
      be with us;' and they themselves come not to the fight but little, <BR>19. 
      Being niggardly of their help to you. But when danger comes, thou seest 
      them looking towards thee, their eyes rolling like one who is fainting at 
      the approach of death. But when the fear has passed away, they assail you 
      with sharp tongues, being niggardly of any good coming to your way. These 
      have never believed; so ALLAH has rendered their works null and void. And 
      that is easy for ALLAH. <BR>20. They still hope that the Confederates may 
      not have gone away; and if the Confederates should come again, they would 
      wish to be among the nomad Arabs in the desert, asking for news about you, 
      they would fight but little. <BR>21. Verily, you have in the Prophet of 
      ALLAH an excellent model, for him who hopes to meet ALLAH and the Last Day 
      and who remembers ALLAH much. <BR>22. And when the believers saw the 
      Confederates, they said, `This is what ALLAH and HIS Messenger promised 
      us; and ALLAH and HIS Messenger spoke the truth.' And it only added to 
      their faith and submission.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
