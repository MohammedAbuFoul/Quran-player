    <TD>24. They said, `O Moses, we will never enter it, so long as they are 
      in it. So go thou and thy Lord and fight, and here we sit.' <BR>25. He 
      said, `My Lord, I have control over myself and my brother, therefore 
      distinguish Thou between us and the rebellious people.' <BR>26. God said: 
      `Verily it shall be forbidden to them for forty years; in distraction 
      shall they wander through the land. So grieve not over the rebellious 
      people. <BR>27. And relate to them with truth the story of the two sons of 
      Adam, when they each offered an offering, and it was accepted from one of 
      them and was not accepted from the other. The latter said, `I will surely 
      kill thee.' The former replied, `ALLAH accepts only from the righteous; 
      <BR>28. `If thou stretch out thy hand against me to kill me, I shall not 
      stretch out my hand against thee to kill thee. I do fear ALLAH, the Lord 
      of the Universe; <BR>29. `I wish that thou shouldst bear the punishment of 
      the sin against me as well as of thine own sin, and thus be among the 
      inmates of the Fire, and that is the recompense of those who do wrong.' 
      <BR>30. But his evil self induced him to kill his brother, and so he 
      killed him and became one of the losers. <BR>31. Then ALLAH sent a raven 
      which scratched in the ground, that HE might show him how to hide the 
      corpse of his brother. He said, `Woe is me ! Am I not able to be even like 
      this raven so that I may hide the corpse of my brother ?' And then he 
      became remorseful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
