          <TD>1. Verily, WE have given thee a clear Victory, <BR>2. That ALLAH 
            may cover up for thee thy shortcomings, past and future, and that HE 
            may complete HIS favour upon thee on a right path; <BR>3. And that 
            ALLAH may help thee with a mighty help. <BR>4. HE it is Who sent 
            down tranquility into the hearts of the believers that they might 
            add faith to their faith - and to ALLAH belong the hosts of the 
            heavens and the earth, and ALLAH is All-Knowing, Wise - <BR>5. That 
            HE may cause the believing men and the believing women to enter the 
            Gardens beneath which streams flow, wherein they will abide, and 
            that HE may remove their evils from them - and that, in the sight of 
            ALLAH, is the supreme achievement; <BR>6. And that HE may punish the 
            hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the idolatrous men 
            and the idolatrous women, who entertain evil thoughts concerning 
            ALLAH. On them shall fall an evil calamity, and the wrath of ALLAH 
            is upon them. And HE has cursed them. And has prepared Hell for 
            them. And that, indeed, is an evil destination. <BR>7. And to ALLAH 
            belong the hosts of the heavens and the earth and ALLAH is Mighty, 
            Wise. <BR>8. WE have sent thee as a witness and a bearer of glad 
            tidings and a Warner, <BR>9. That you should believe in ALLAH and 
            HIS Messenger, and may help him, and honour him, and that you may 
            glorify ALLAH morning and evening.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
