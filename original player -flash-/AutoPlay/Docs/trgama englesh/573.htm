    <TD>14. `And some of us submit to God and some of us have deviated from 
      the right course.' And those who submit to God - it is they who seek the 
      right course, <BR>15. And those who deviate from the right course, they 
      are the fuel of Hell. <BR>16. And if the Meccan disbelievers keep to the 
      right path, WE shall, certainly, provide them with abundant water to 
      drink, <BR>17. That WE may try them thereby. And whoso turns away from the 
      remembrance of his Lord - HE will drive him into an over-whelmingly severe 
      punishment. <BR>18. And all places of worship belong to ALLAH; so call not 
      on anyone beside ALLAH. <BR>19. And when the servant of ALLAH stands up 
      praying to HIM, they crowd upon him, well-nigh stifling him to death. 
      <BR>20. Say, `I pray to my Lord only, and I associate no one with HIM. 
      <BR>21. Say, I have no power to do you either harm or good.' <BR>22. Say, 
      `Surely, none can protect me against the punishment of ALLAH, nor can I 
      find any place of refuge beside HIM.' <BR>23. `My responsibility is only 
      to convey what is revealed to me from ALLAH and HIS Messages.' And those 
      who disobey ALLAH and HIS Messenger, surely, for them is the Fire of Hell, 
      wherein they will abide for a long period. <BR>24. They will continue to 
      disbelieve until they see that which they are promised, but soon they will 
      know who is weaker in helpers and fewer in numbers. <BR>25. Say, `I know 
      not whether that which you are promised is nigh, or whether my Lord has 
      fixed for it a distant term.' <BR>26. HE is the Knower of the unseen; and 
      HE reveals not HIS secrets to anyone, <BR>27. Except to a Messenger of HIS 
      whom HE chooses. And then HE causes an escort of guarding angels to go 
      before him and behind him, <BR>28. That HE may know that HIS Messengers 
      have delivered the Messages of their Lord. And HE encompasses all that is 
      with them and HE keeps count of all 
things.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
