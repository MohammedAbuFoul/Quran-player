    <TD>1. Those who disbelieve and hinder men from the way of ALLAH - HE 
      renders their works vain. <BR>2. But as for those who believe and do 
      righteous deeds and believe in that which has been revealed to Muhammad - 
      and it is the truth from their Lord - HE removes from them their sins and 
      sets right their affairs. <BR>3. That is because those who disbelieve 
      follow falsehood while those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. 
      Thus does ALLAH set forth for men their lessons by similitudes. <BR>4. And 
      when you meet in regular battle those who disbelieve, smite their necks; 
      and, when you have overcome them, by causing great slaughter among them, 
      bind fast the fetters - then afterwards either release them as a favour or 
      by taking ransom - until the war lays down its burdens. That is the 
      ordinance. And if ALLAH had so pleased, HE could have punished them 
      Himself, but HE has willed that HE may try some of you by others. And 
      those who are killed in the way of ALLAH - HE will never render their 
      works vain. <BR>5. HE will guide them to success and will improve their 
      condition. <BR>6. And will admit them into the Garden which HE has made 
      known to them. <BR>7. O ye who believe ! if you help the cause of ALLAH, 
      HE will help you and will make your steps firm. <BR>8. But those who 
      disbelieve, perdition is their lot; and HE will make their works vain. 
      <BR>9. That is because they hate what ALLAH has revealed; so HE has made 
      their works vain. <BR>10. Have they not traveled in the earth and seen 
      what was the end of those who were before them ? ALLAH utterly destroyed 
      them, and for the disbelievers there will be the like thereof. <BR>11. 
      That is because ALLAH is the Protector of those who believe, and the 
      disbelievers have no 
protector.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
