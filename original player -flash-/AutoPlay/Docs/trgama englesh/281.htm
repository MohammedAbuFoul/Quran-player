    <TD>119. Then, surely, thy Lord - to those who do evil in ignorance and 
      repent thereafter and make amends - surely, after that thy Lord is Most 
      Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>120. Abraham was indeed a paragon of virtue, 
      obedient to ALLAH, ever inclined to HIM , and he was not of those who set 
      up equals with ALLAH; <BR>121. Ever grateful for HIS favours: HE chose him 
      and guided him to a straight path. <BR>122. And WE bestowed on him good in 
      this world, and in the Hereafter he will surely be among the righteous. 
      <BR>123. And now WE have sent revelation to thee, enjoining, `Follow the 
      way of Abraham who was ever inclined to ALLAH and was not of those who set 
      up equals to HIM.' <BR>124. The punishment for profaning the Sabbath was 
      imposed only on those who had differed about it and thy Lord will surely 
      judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they 
      differed. <BR>125. Call unto the way of thy Lord with wisdom and goodly 
      exhortation and argue with them in a way that is best. Surely, thy Lord 
      knows best who has strayed from HIS way; and HE also knows those who are 
      rightly guided. <BR>126. And if you decide to punish the oppressors, then 
      punish them to the extent to which you have been wronged; but if you show 
      patience then, surely, that is best for those who are patient. <BR>127. 
      And, O Prophet, endure thou with patience; and verily thy patience is 
      possible only with the help of ALLAH. And grieve not for them, nor feel 
      distressed because of their evil designs. <BR>128. Verily, ALLAH is with 
      those who are righteous and those who do 
good.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
