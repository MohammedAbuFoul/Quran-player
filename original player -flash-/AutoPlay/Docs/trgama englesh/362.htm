    <TD>21. And those, who do not expect a meeting with US, say, `Why are not 
      angels sent down to us ? Or, why do we not see our Lord ?' Surely, they 
      are too proud of themselves and have gone far in rebellion. <BR>22. On the 
      day when they see the angels - there will be no good tidings on that day 
      for the guilty; and they will cry in distress, `Would that there were a 
      strong barrier ! <BR>23. And WE shall turn to the work they did and WE 
      shall scatter it into particles of dust. <BR>24. The inmates of Heaven on 
      that day will be better off as regards their abode, and better off in 
      respect of their place of repose. <BR>25. And on that day when the heaven 
      shall burst asunder with the clouds overhanging it, and the angels shall 
      be sent down in large numbers - <BR>26. The true Kingdom on that day shall 
      belong to the Gracious, God; and it shall be a hard day for the 
      disbelievers. <BR>27. On that day the wrongdoer will bite his hands and 
      will say, `O, would that I had taken a way along with the Messenger ! 
      <BR>28. `O, woe is me ! would that I had never taken such a one for a 
      friend ! <BR>29. `He led me astray from the Reminder after it had come to 
      me.' And Satan always deserts man in the hour of need. <BR>30. And the 
      Messenger will say, `O my Lord, my people indeed treated this Qur'an as a 
      thing to be discarded.' <BR>31. Thus did WE make for every Prophet an 
      enemy from among the sinners; And sufficient is thy Lord as a Guide and a 
      Helper. <BR>32. And those who disbelieve say, `Why was not the Qur'an 
      revealed to him all at once ?' WE have revealed it in this manner that WE 
      may strengthen thy heart therewith. And WE have arranged it in the Best 
      form.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
