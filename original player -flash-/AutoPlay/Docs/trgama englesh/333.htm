    <TD>6. That is because ALLAH is Self-Subsisting and All-Sustaining, and 
      that it is HE Who brings the dead to life, and that HE has power over all 
      things; <BR>7. And because the Hour will certainly come, there is no doubt 
      about it, and because ALLAH will raise up those who are in the graves. 
      <BR>8. And among men is he who disputes concerning ALLAH without knowledge 
      and without guidance and without an illuminating Book, <BR>9. Turning his 
      side disdainfully, that he may lead men astray from the way of ALLAH. For 
      him is disgrace in this world; and on the Day of Resurrection WE shall 
      make him taste the punishment of burning. <BR>10. This is because of what 
      thy hands have sent on before, and ALLAH is not unjust to HIS servants. 
      <BR>11. And among men is he who serves ALLAH, standing, as it were, on the 
      verge. Then if good befalls him, he is content therewith; and if there 
      befalls him a trial, he returns to his former way. He loses both this 
      world as well as the Hereafter. That indeed is a manifest loss. <BR>12. He 
      calls beside ALLAH on that which can neither harm him nor benefit him. 
      That is indeed straying far away. <BR>13. He calls on him whose harm is 
      much more likely than his benefit. Evil indeed is the patron, and evil 
      indeed the associate. <BR>14. Verily, ALLAH will cause those who believe 
      and do good deeds to enter Gardens beneath which streams flow; surely, 
      ALLAH does what HE pleases. <BR>15. Whoso thinks that ALLAH will not help 
      him in this world and the Hereafter, let him stretch a rope to heaven, and 
      let him cut it off. Then let him see if his device can remove that which 
      enrages him.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
