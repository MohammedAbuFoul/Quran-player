    <TD>22. Is he then whose bosom ALLAH has opened for the acceptance of 
      Islam, so that he possesses a light from his Lord, like him who is 
      grouping in the darkness of disbelief ? Woe, then, to those whose hearts 
      are hardened against the remembrance of ALLAH ! They are in manifest 
      error. <BR>23. ALLAH has sent down the Best Discourse - a Book, whose 
      verses are mutually supporting and repeated in diverse forms. The skins of 
      those, who fear their Lord, do creep at its recital, then their skins and 
      their hearts soften to the remembrance of ALLAH. Such is the guidance of 
      ALLAH. HE guides therewith whom HE pleases. And he whom ALLAH adjudges 
      astray - he shall have no guide. <BR>24. Is he, then, who has only his own 
      face to shield from the evil punishment on the Day of Resurrection, like 
      him who is secure ? And it will be said to the wrongdoers, `Taste ye the 
      recompense of what you used to earn.' <BR>25. Those, who were before them, 
      rejected Our Messengers, so the punishment came upon them whence they knew 
      not. <BR>26. So ALLAH made them taste humiliation in the present life and 
      the punishment of the Hereafter will certainly be greater, if they but 
      knew. <BR>27. And, indeed, WE have set forth for mankind all manner of 
      parables in this Qur'an that they may take heed. <BR>28. WE have revealed 
      the Qur'an in Arabic wherein there is no deviation from rectitude, that 
      they may become righteous. <BR>29. ALLAH sets forth a parable - a man 
      belonging to several partners, who disagree with one another, and a man 
      belonging wholly to one man. Are the two equal in condition ? All praise 
      belongs to ALLAH. But most of them know not. <BR>30. Surely, thou wilt 
      die, and surely, they too, will die. <BR>31. Then, surely, on the day of 
      Resurrection you will dispute with one another before your 
  Lord.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
