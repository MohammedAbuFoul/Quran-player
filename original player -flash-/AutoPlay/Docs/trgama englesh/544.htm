    <TD>12. O ye who believe ! when you consult the Messenger in private, give 
      alms before your consultation. That is better for you and purer. But if 
      you find not anything to give then ALLAH is Most Forgiving, Merciful. 
      <BR>13. Are you afraid of giving alms before your consultation ? So when 
      you do not do so and ALLAH has been Merciful to you, then observe Prayer 
      and pay the Zakaat and obey ALLAH and HIS Messenger. And ALLAH is 
      Well-Aware of what you do. <BR>14. Seest thou not those who take for 
      friends a people with whom ALLAH is wroth ? They are neither of you nor of 
      them, and they swear to falsehood knowingly. <BR>15. ALLAH has prepared 
      for them a severe punishment. Evil, indeed, is that which they used to do. 
      <BR>16. They have made their oaths a shield for their falsehoods, and 
      thereby they seek to turn men away from the path of ALLAH; for them 
      therefore, will be an humiliating punishment. <BR>17. Neither their wealth 
      nor their children will avail them aught against ALLAH. They are the 
      inmates of the Fire wherein they will abide. <BR>18. On the day when ALLAH 
      will raise them all together, they will swear to HIM, even as they now 
      swear to you, and they will think that they have something to stand upon. 
      Now, surely, it is they who are the liars. <BR>19. Satan has gained 
      mastery over them, and has made them forget the remembrance of ALLAH. They 
      are Satan's party. Now, surely, it is Satan's party that are the losers. 
      <BR>20. Certainly those who oppose ALLAH and His Messenger are among the 
      most abject. <BR>21. ALLAH has decreed: `Most surely, I will prevail, I 
      and MY Messengers.' Verily, ALLAH is Powerful, 
Mighty.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
