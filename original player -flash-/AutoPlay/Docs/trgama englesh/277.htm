    <TD>88. As for those who disbelieve and turn men away from the way of 
      ALLAH, WE will add punishment to their punishment because they made 
      mischief. <BR>89. And remember the day when WE will raise up in every 
      people a witness against them from among themselves, and WE will bring 
      thee as a witness against all of them. And WE have sent down to thee the 
      Book to explain everything and a guidance and a mercy and glad tidings to 
      those who submit to ALLAH. <BR>90. Verily, ALLAH enjoins justice, and the 
      doing of good to others; and giving like kindred; and forbids indecency 
      and manifest evil and transgression. HE admonishes you that you may take 
      heed. <BR>91. And fulfill the covenant of ALLAH when you have made one, 
      and break not your oaths after making them firm, while you have made ALLAH 
      your surety. Certainly, ALLAH knows what you do. <BR>92. And be not like 
      unto her who cuts up her yarn into pieces after having spun it strong by 
      making your oaths a means of deceit between you, for fear lest one people 
      become more powerful than another people. Surely, ALLAH tries you 
      therewith, and on the Day of Resurrection HE will make clear to you that 
      wherein you differed. <BR>93. And if ALLAH had enforced HIS will, HE would 
      surely have made you all one people; but HE lets go astray him who wishes 
      it, and guides him who wishes it, and you shall surely be questioned 
      concerning that which you have been 
doing.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
