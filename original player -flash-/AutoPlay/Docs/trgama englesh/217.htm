    <TD>71. And recite unto them the story of Noah, when he said to his 
      people, `O my people, if my station with God and my reminding you of your 
      duty through the Signs of ALLAH offend you - and in ALLAH do I put my 
      trust - muster then all your designs, and your associated-gods; then let 
      not your course of action remain obscure to you in any respect; then carry 
      out your designs against me and give me no respite, <BR>72. `But if you 
      turn back, then remember, I have not asked of you any reward. My reward is 
      with ALLAH alone, and I have been commanded to be of those who are wholly 
      resigned to Him. <BR>73. But they rejected him, so WE saved him and those 
      who were with him in the Ark. And WE made them inheritors of Our favours, 
      while WE drowned those who rejected our Signs. See then, how evil was the 
      end of those who had been warned. <BR>74. The WE sent, after him, other 
      Messengers to their respective peoples, and they brought them clear 
      proofs. But they would not believe in them, because they had rejected them 
      before. Thus do WE seal the hearts of the transgressors. <BR>75. Then WE 
      sent after them Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our Signs, 
      but they behaved arrogantly. And they were a sinful people. <BR>76. And 
      when there came to them the truth from US, they said, `This is surely a 
      manifest enchantment.' <BR>77. Moses said, `Do you say this of the truth 
      when it has come to you ? Can this be enchantment ? And the enchanters 
      never prosper. <BR>78. They said, `Hast thou come to us that thou mayest 
      turn us away from what we found our fathers following, and that you two 
      may have greatness in the land ? But we will not believe in either of 
      you.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
