    <TD>28. And keep thyself attached to those who call on their Lord morning 
      and evening, seeking HIS pleasure; and let not thine eyes pass beyond 
      them, seeking the adornment of the life of the world; and obey not him 
      whose heart WE have made heedless of OUR remembrance and who follows his 
      low desires, and his case exceeds all legitimate bounds. <BR>29. And say, 
      `It is the truth from your Lord; wherefore let him who will, believe, and 
      let him, who will, disbelieve.' Verily, WE have prepared for the 
      wrongdoers a fire whose flaming canopy shall enclose them. And if they cry 
      for help, they will be helped with water like molten lead which would 
      scale their faces. How dreadful the drink and how evil the resting place ! 
      <BR>30. Verily, those who believe and do good works - surely WE suffer not 
      the reward of those who do good works to be lost. <BR>31. It is these who 
      will have Gardens of Eternity underneath which streams shall flow. They 
      will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and will wear green 
      garments of fine silk and heavy brocade, reclining therein upon raised 
      couches. How good the reward and how excellent the place of rest ! <BR>32. 
      And set forth for them the parable of two men - one of them WE provided 
      with two gardens of grapes and surrounded them with date-palms, and 
      between the two WE placed cornfields. <BR>33. Each of the gardens yielded 
      its fruits in abundance and failed not the least therein. And in between 
      the two WE caused a stream to flow. <BR>34. And he had fruit in abundance. 
      And he said to his companion boastfully, arguing with him, `I am richer 
      than thou in wealth and stronger in respect of 
men.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
