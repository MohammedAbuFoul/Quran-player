    <TD>1. O thou Prophet, seek protection in ALLAH, and follow not the wishes 
      of the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Verily, ALLAH is All-Knowing, 
      Wise. <BR>2. And follow that which is revealed to thee from thy Lord. 
      Verily, ALLAH is Well-Aware of what you do. <BR>3. And put thy trust in 
      ALLAH, and ALLAH is sufficient as a Guardian. <BR>4. ALLAH has not made 
      for any man two hearts in his breast; nor has HE made those of your wives 
      from whom you keep away by calling them mothers, your mothers in fact, nor 
      has HE made those whom you adopt as sons, your sons in fact. These are 
      merely the words of your mouths; but ALLAH declares the truth, and HE 
      guides to the right path. <BR>5. Call them after their fathers. That is 
      more equitable in the sight of ALLAH. But if you know not their fathers, 
      then they are your brothers in Faith and your friends. And there is no 
      blame on you in respect of any mistake you may unintentionally make in 
      this matter; but you will be called to account for that which your hearts 
      purpose. And ALLAH is Most Forgiving. Ever Merciful. <BR>6. The Prophet is 
      nearer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are as 
      mothers to them. And blood-relations are nearer to one another, according 
      to the Book of ALLAH, than other believers from among the Helpers and the 
      Emigrants except that you show kindness to your friends. This is also 
      written down in the Book.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
