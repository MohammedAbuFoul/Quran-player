    <TD>87. ALLAH is HE besides Whom there is none worthy of worship. HE will 
      certainly continue to assemble you till the Day of Resurrection about 
      which there is no doubt. And who is more truthful in his word than ALLAH ? 
      <BR>88. What is the matter with you that you are divided into two parties 
      regarding the Hypocrites ? And ALLAH has overthrown them because of what 
      they earned. Desire ye to guide him whom ALLAH has caused to perish ? And 
      for him whom ALLAH causes to perish thou shalt not find a way. <BR>89. 
      They wish that you should disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so that you 
      may become alike. Take not, therefore, friends from among them, until they 
      emigrate in the way of ALLAH. And if they turn away, then seize them and 
      kill them wherever you find them; and take no friend nor helper from among 
      them; <BR>90. Except those who are connected with a people between whom 
      and you there is a pact, or those who come to you, while their hearts 
      shrink from fighting you or fighting their own people. And if ALLAH had so 
      pleased, HE could have given them power against you, then they would have 
      surely fought you. So, if they keep aloof from you and fight you not, and 
      make you an offer of peace, then ALLAH has allowed you no way of 
      aggression against them. <BR>91. You will find others who desire to be 
      secure from you and to be secure from their own people. Whenever they are 
      made to revert to hostility, they fall headlong into it. Therefore, if 
      they do not keep aloof from you nor offer you peace nor restrain their 
      hands, then seize them and kill them, wherever you find them. Against 
      these WE have given you clear 
authority.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
