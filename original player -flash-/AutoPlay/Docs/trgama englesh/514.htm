    <TD>24. And HE it is Who withheld their hands from you and your hands from 
      them in the valley of Mecca, after HE had given you victory over them. And 
      ALLAH sees all that you do. <BR>25. It is they who disbelieved and 
      debarred you from the Sacred Mosque and also prevented the dedicated 
      offerings from reaching their place of sacrifice. And had it not been for 
      some believing men and believing women who were then in Mecca and whom, 
      not having known, you might have trampled down, and thus might have, on 
      their account, incurred an unwitting guilt, HE would have permitted you to 
      fight, but HE withheld you that HE might admit into HIS mercy whom HE 
      will. If they had been clearly separated from the disbelievers, WE would 
      have, surely, punished those of them who disbelieved with a grievous 
      punishment. <BR>26. When those who disbelieved harboured in their hearts 
      prideful indignation - indignation of the Days of Ignorance, ALLAH sent 
      down HIS tranquility on HIS Messenger and on the believers, and made them 
      adhere firmly to the principle of righteousness, and they were better 
      entitled to it and more worthy of it. And ALLAH knows everything well. 
      <BR>27. ALLAH, indeed, fulfilled for HIS Messenger the Vision: You shall 
      certainly enter the Sacred Mosque, if ALLAH will, in security, some of you 
      having their heads shaven and others having their hair cut short, you will 
      have no fear. But HE knew what you knew not. HE has, in fact, ordained for 
      you, besides that, a victory near at hand. <BR>28. HE it is Who has sent 
      HIS Messenger with guidance and the true Religion, That HE may cause it to 
      prevail over all other religions. And sufficient is ALLAH as a 
    Witness.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
