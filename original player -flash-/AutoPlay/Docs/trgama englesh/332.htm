    <TD>1. O people, fear your Lord; Verily the earthquake of the Hour is a 
      tremendous thing - <BR>2. On the day when you see it, every woman giving 
      suck shall forget her suckling and every pregnant woman shall cast her 
      burden; and thou shalt see men as they were drunken while they will not be 
      drunken, but severe will indeed be the chastisement of ALLAH. <BR>3. And 
      among men there are some who dispute about ALLAH without knowledge and 
      follow every rebellious satan - <BR>4. Concerning whom it is decreed that 
      whosoever makes friends with him, him he will lead astray and will guide 
      to the torment of the Fire. <BR>5. O people, if you are in doubt 
      concerning the Resurrection, then consider that WE have indeed created you 
      from dust, then from a sperm drop, then from clotted blood, then from a 
      lump of flesh, partly formed and partly unformed, in order that WE make 
      Our power manifest to you. And WE cause what WE will to remain in the 
      wombs for an appointed term; then WE bring you forth as babes; then WE 
      rear you that you may attain to your age of full strength. And there are 
      some of you who are caused to die in the normal course, and there are 
      others among you are kept back till the worst part of life with the result 
      that they know nothing after having had knowledge. And thou seest the 
      earth lifeless, but when WE send down water thereon it stirs and swells 
      and grows every kind of beauteous vegetation.
