    <TD>8. `Our Lord, make them enter the Gardens of Eternity which Thou hast 
      promised them, as well as such of their fathers and their wives and their 
      children as are virtuous. Surely, Thou art the Mighty, the Wise; <BR>9. 
      `And guard them against evils; and he whom Thou dost guard against evils 
      on that day - him hast Thou, surely, shown mercy. And that, indeed, is the 
      mighty triumph.' <BR>10. It will be announced to those who disbelieve: 
      `Greater was the abhorrence of ALLAH, when you were called to the faith 
      and you disbelieved, than your own abhorrence of yourselves today.' 
      <BR>11. They will say, `Our Lord, Thou hast caused us to die twice, and 
      Thou hast given us life twice and now we confess our sins. Is, then, there 
      a way out ?' <BR>12. It will be said to them, `This is because, when ALLAH 
      alone was called upon, you disbelieved, but when partners were associated 
      with HIM, you believed. The decision now rests only with ALLAH, the High, 
      the Incomparably Great.' <BR>13. HE it is who shows you HIS Signs and 
      sends down provision for you from heaven; but none pays heed save he who 
      turns to ALLAH. <BR>14. Call ye, then, upon ALLAH, devoting your obedience 
      wholly and sincerely to HIM, though the disbelievers may be averse to it. 
      <BR>15. HE is of most exalted attributes, Lord of the Throne. HE sends HIS 
      Word by HIS command to whomsoever of HIS servants HE pleases, that HE may 
      give warning of the Day of Meeting, <BR>16. The day when they will all 
      come forth; nothing concerning them will be hidden from ALLAH. `Whose is 
      the Kingdom this day !' It is ALLAH's, the one, the Most 
  Supreme.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
