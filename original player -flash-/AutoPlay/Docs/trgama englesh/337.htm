    <TD>39. Permission to take up arms is given to those against whom war is 
      made, because they have been wronged and ALLAH, indeed, has power to help 
      them. - <BR>40. Those who have been driven out from their homes unjustly, 
      only because they said, `Our Lord is ALLAH.' And if ALLAH had not repelled 
      some people by means of others, cloisters and churches and synagogues and 
      mosques, wherein the name of ALLAH is oft remembered, would surely have 
      been destroyed. And ALLAH will, surely, help him who helps HIM. ALLAH is, 
      indeed, Powerful, Mighty - <BR>41. Those who, if WE establish them in the 
      earth, will observe Prayer and pay the Zak?t and enjoin good and forbid 
      evil. And with ALLAH rests the final issue of all affairs. <BR>42. And if 
      they accuse thee of falsehood, even so, before them, the people of Noah 
      and the tribes of Ad and Thamud also accused their prophets of falsehood; 
      <BR>43. And so did the people of Abraham and the people of Lot; <BR>44. 
      And the inhabitants of Midian. And Moses too was accused of falsehood. But 
      I gave respite to the disbelievers; Then I seized them, and how terrible 
      were the consequences of denying ME ! <BR>45. And how many a city have WE 
      destroyed, which was given to wrongdoing, so that it is fallen down on its 
      roofs; and how many a well is deserted and how many a lofty castle lies in 
      ruins ! <BR>46. Have they not traveled in the land, so that they may have 
      hearts wherewith to understand, or ears wherewith to hear ? For, surely, 
      it is not the eyes that are blind, but blind are the hearts which are in 
      the breasts.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
