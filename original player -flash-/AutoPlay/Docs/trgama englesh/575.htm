    <TD>20. Surely, thy Lord knows that thou standest up praying for nearly 
      two-thirds of the night, and sometimes half or a third thereof and also a 
      party of those who are with thee. And ALLAH determines the measure of the 
      night and the day. HE knows that you cannot calculate the time accurately, 
      so HE has turned to you in mercy. Recite, then, as much of the Qur'an as 
      is easy for you. HE knows that there will be some among you who may be 
      sick, and others who may travel in the land, seeking ALLAH's bounty, and 
      others who may fight in the cause of ALLAH. So recite of it that which is 
      easy for you, and observe Prayer and pay the Zakat and lend to ALLAH a 
      goodly loan. And whatever good you may send on before you for your souls, 
      you will find it with ALLAH. It will be better and greater in reward. And 
      seek forgiveness of ALLAH. Surely, ALLAH is Most Forgiving, Merciful.

      1. O thou who hast covered thyself with thy cloak, <BR>2. Arise and warn, 
      <BR>3. And thy Lord do thou magnify, <BR>4. And thy clothes do thou 
      purify, <BR>5. And uncleanliness do thou shun, <BR>6. And bestow not 
      favours seeking to get more in return, <BR>7. And for the sake of thy Lord 
      do thou endure trials patiently. <BR>8. And when the trumpet is sounded, 
      <BR>9. That day will be a hard day, <BR>10. For the disbelievers it will 
      not be easy. <BR>11. Leave ME alone to deal with him whom I created. 
      <BR>12. And I gave him abundant wealth, <BR>13. And sons, dwelling in his 
      presence, <BR>14. And equipped him with all necessary things, <BR>15. Yet 
      he desires that I should give him more. <BR>16. Certainly not ! for he was 
      stubbornly opposed to Our Signs. <BR>17. I shall inflict on him an 
      increasingly overwhelming 
torment.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
