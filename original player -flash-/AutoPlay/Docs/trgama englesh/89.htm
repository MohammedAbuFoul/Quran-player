    <TD>66. And if WE had commanded them: Slay your people or leave your 
      homes,' they would not have done it except a few of them; and if they had 
      done what they are exhorted to do, it would surely have been better for 
      them and conducive to greater strength; <BR>67. And then WE would have 
      surely, given them a great reward from Ourselves; <BR>68. And WE could 
      surely have guided them in the right path. <BR>69. And whoso obeys ALLAH 
      and this Messenger shall be among those on whom ALLAH has bestowed HIS 
      blessings - the Prophets, the Truthful, the Martyrs, and the Righteous. 
      And an excellent company are they. <BR>70. This grace is from ALLAH, and 
      ALLAH suffices as One Who is All-Knowing. <BR>71. O ye who believe ! take 
      your precautions for security, then go forth in separate parties or go 
      forth all together. <BR>72. And among you there is he who tarries behind, 
      and if a misfortune befalls you, he says, `Surely ALLAH has been gracious 
      to me, since I was not present with them.' <BR>73. But if there comes to 
      you good fortune from ALLAH, he says, as if there were no love between you 
      and him, `Would that I had been with them, then should I have indeed 
      achieved a great success !' <BR>74. Let those then fight in the cause of 
      ALLAH who would sell the present life for the Hereafter. And whoso fights 
      in the cause of ALLAH, be he slain or be he victorious, WE shall soon give 
      him a great reward.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
