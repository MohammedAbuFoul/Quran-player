    <TD>84. `And grant me true and lasting reputation among posterity; <BR>85. 
      `And make me one of the heirs of the Garden of Bliss; <BR>86. `And forgive 
      my father, for he is of the erring ones; <BR>87. `And disgrace me not on 
      the day when they will be raised up, <BR>88. `The day when wealth and sons 
      shall not avail; <BR>89. `Save him who comes to ALLAH with a sound heart.' 
      <BR>90. And Heaven shall be brought near to the righteous. <BR>91. And 
      Hell shall be placed in full view to those who have gone astray. <BR>92. 
      And it will be said to them, `Where are those that you worshiped <BR>93. 
      `Beside ALLAH ? Can they help you or help themselves ?' <BR>94. Then will 
      they be thrown headlong therein, they and those who have gone astray, 
      <BR>95. And the Hosts of Iblis, all together. <BR>96. They will say, 
      whilst they dispute between themselves therein, <BR>97. `By ALLAH, we were 
      in manifest error, <BR>98. `When we held you as equal with the Lord of the 
      worlds, <BR>99. `And none led us astray but the guilty ones, <BR>100. `And 
      now we have no intercessors, <BR>101. `Nor any warm friend; <BR>102. 
      `Could we but return to the world, we would be among the believers !' 
      <BR>103. In this, verily, there is a Sign; but most of these would not 
      believe. <BR>104. And verily thy Lord - HE is the Mighty, the Merciful. 
      <BR>105. The people of Noah treated the Messengers as liars, <BR>106. When 
      their brother Noah said to them, `Will you not be God-Fearing ? <BR>107. 
      `Surely I am unto you a Messenger, faithful to my trust <BR>108. `So fear 
      ALLAH and obey me; <BR>109. `And I ask you no reward for it. My reward is 
      only with the Lord of the worlds; <BR>110. `So fear ALLAH and obey me; 
      <BR>111. They said, `Shall we believe, in thee when it is the meanest of 
      us who follow thee ?'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
