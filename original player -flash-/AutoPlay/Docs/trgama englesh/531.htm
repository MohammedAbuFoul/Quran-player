    <TD>50. And Our command is carried out by only one Word as the twinkling 
      of an eye. <BR>51. And, indeed, WE have destroyed people like you before. 
      But is there anyone who will take heed ? <BR>52. And everything they have 
      done is recorded in the Books. <BR>53. And every matter, small and great, 
      is written down. <BR>54. Verily, the righteous will be in the midst of 
      Gardens and streams, <BR>55. In an internal and honoured abode in the 
      presence of the Omnipotent King. <BR>&nbsp;
      <HR width="90%" color=#000000 SIZE=3>
      1. The Gracious God. <BR>2. HE taught the Qur'an. <BR>3. HE created man, 
      <BR>4. And taught him plain speech. <BR>5. The sun and the moon run their 
      courses according to a fixed reckoning. <BR>6. And the stemless plants and 
      the trees humbly submit to HIS Will. <BR>7. And the heaven HE has raised 
      high and set up the measure, <BR>8. That you may not exceed the measure. 
      <BR>9. So weigh all things with justice and fall not short of the measure. 
      <BR>10. And HE has set the earth for HIS creatures; <BR>11. Therein are 
      all kinds of fruit and palm-tree with sheaths, <BR>12. And grain with its 
      husk and fragrant plants. <BR>13. Which, then, of the favours of your Lord 
      will ye twain, O men and jinn, deny ? <BR>14. He created man of dry 
      ringing clay which is like baked pottery. <BR>15. And the jinn HE created 
      of the flame of Fire. <BR>16. Which, then, of the favours of your Lord 
      will ye twain, deny ?&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
