    <TD>52. Those are they whom ALLAH has cursed, and he whom ALLAH curses, 
      thou shalt not find for him a helper. <BR>53. Have they a share in the 
      kingdom ? Then they would not give men even so much as a the little hollow 
      in the back of a date-stone. <BR>54. Or do they envy men for what ALLAH 
      has given them out of HIS bounty ? If that is so, surely, WE gave the 
      children of Abraham the Book and wisdom and WE gave them a great kingdom. 
      <BR>55. And of them were some who believed in him; and of them were others 
      who turned away from him. And sufficient for them as punishment is the 
      blazing fire of Hell. <BR>56. Those who disbelieve in Our Signs, We shall 
      soon cause them to enter Fire. As often as their skins are burnt up, WE 
      shall give them in exchange other skins that they may continue to taste 
      the punishment. Surely, ALLAH is Mighty and Wise. <BR>57. And those who 
      believe and do good works. WE shall make them enter Gardens through which 
      streams flow, to abide therein for ever; therein shall they have pure 
      spouses, and WE shall admit them to a place of plenteous shade. <BR>58. 
      Verily ALLAH commands you to give over the trusts to those entitled to 
      them, and that, when you judge between men, you judge with justice. And 
      surely, excellent is that with which ALLAH admonishes you. ALLAH is 
      All-Hearing, All-Seeing. <BR>59. O ye who believe ! obey ALLAH, and obey 
      His Messenger and those who are in authority among you. And if you differ 
      in anything refer it to ALLAH and His Messenger, if you are believers in 
      ALLAH and the Last Day. That is best and most commendable in the 
    end.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
