    <TD>119. And what reason have you that you should not eat of that over 
      which the name of ALLAH has been pronounced when HE has already explained 
      to you that which HE has forbidden unto you, -save that which you are 
      forced to. And surely many mislead others by their evil desires through 
      lack of knowledge. Assuredly, thy Lord knows best the transgressors. 
      <BR>120. And eschew open sins as well as secret ones. Surely those who 
      earn sin will be rewarded for that which they have earned. <BR>121. And 
      eat not of that on which the name of ALLAH has not been pronounced, for 
      surely that is abomination. And certainly the evil ones inspire their 
      friends with such thoughts that they may dispute with you. And if you obey 
      them, you will indeed be of those who set up gods with ALLAH. <BR>122. Can 
      he, who was dead, then WE gave him life and made for him a light whereby 
      he walks among men, be like him whose condition is that he is in utter 
      darkness whence he cannot come forth ? Thus have the doings of the 
      disbelievers been made to seem fair to them. <BR>123. And thus have WE 
      made in every town the leaders of its wicked ones that their doings seem 
      fair to them with the result that they plot therein against the Messengers 
      of ALLAH and they plot not except against their own souls; but they 
      perceive not. <BR>124. And when there comes to them a Sign, they say, `We 
      will not believe until we are given the like of that which ALLAH's 
      Messengers have been given.' ALLAH knows best where to place HIS Message. 
      Surely, humiliation before ALLAH and a severe punishment shall afflict the 
      offenders because of their 
plotting.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
