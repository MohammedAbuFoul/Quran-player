    <TD>52. And surely WE have brought them a Book which WE have expounded 
      with knowledge, a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe. <BR>53. 
      Do they wait only for the fulfillment of warnings thereof ? On the day 
      when the fulfillment thereof shall come, those who had forgotten it before 
      shall say, `The Messengers of our Lord did indeed bring the Truth. Have we 
      then any intercessors to intercede for us ? Or could we be sent back so 
      that we might do good deeds, other than that which we used to do ?' They 
      have indeed ruined their souls and that which they used to fabricate has 
      failed them. <BR>54. Surely, your Lord is ALLAH, who created the heavens 
      and the earth in six periods, then HE settled Himself firmly on the 
      Throne. HE makes the night cover the day, which it pursues swiftly, And HE 
      created the sun and the moon and the stars - all made subservient by HIS 
      command. Verily, HIS is the creation and the command. Blessed is ALLAH, 
      Lord of the worlds. <BR>55. Call upon your Lord humbly and in secret. 
      Surely, HE does not love the transgressors. <BR>56. And create not 
      disorder in the earth after it has been set in order, and call upon HIM in 
      fear and in hope. Surely, the mercy of ALLAH is nigh unto those who do 
      good. <BR>57. And HE it is Who sends the winds as glad tidings before HIS 
      mercy till, when they bear a heavy cloud, WE drive it to a dead land; then 
      WE send down water therefrom and WE bring forth fruits of every kind. In 
      like manner do WE bring forth the dead that you may 
  remember.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
