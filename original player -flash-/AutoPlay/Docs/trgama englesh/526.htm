    <TD>1. By the star when it falls, <BR>2. You companion has neither erred, 
      nor has he gone astray, <BR>3. Nor does he speak out of his own desire. 
      <BR>4. It is nothing but pure revelation revealed by God. <BR>5. The Lord 
      of the Mighty Powers has taught him, <BR>6. The One Possessor of Powers 
      which manifest themselves repeatedly. So HE settled Himself on the Throne. 
      <BR>7. And HE revealed His Word when he was on the uppermost horizon. 
      <BR>8. Then the Prophet drew near to ALLAH; then ALLAH leaned down towards 
      him. <BR>9. So that HE became, as it were, one chord to two bows, or 
      closer still. <BR>10. Then ALLAH revealed to HIS servant that which HE 
      revealed. <BR>11. The heart of the Prophet lied not in seeing what he saw 
      ? <BR>12. Will you, then, dispute with him about what he saw ? <BR>13. 
      And, certainly, he saw him a second time; <BR>14. Near the farthest lote 
      tree; <BR>15. Near which is the Garden of Eternal abode. <BR>16. This was 
      when that, which covers, covered the lote-tree. <BR>17. The eye deviated 
      not, nor did it wander. <BR>18. Surely, he saw the greatest of the Signs 
      of his Lord. <BR>19. Now tell me about Lat and Uzza; <BR>20. And Manat, 
      the third one, another goddess. <BR>21. `What ! for you the males and for 
      Him the females ?' <BR>22. That, indeed is an unfair division. <BR>23. 
      These are but names which you have named - you and your fathers - for 
      which ALLAH has sent down no authority. They follow naught but conjecture 
      and what their souls desire, while there has already come to them guidance 
      from their Lord. <BR>24. Can man have whatever he desires ? <BR>25. Nay, 
      to ALLAH belong the Hereafter and this world. <BR>26. And how many an 
      angel is there in the heavens, but their intercession shall be of no 
      avail, except after ALLAH gives permission to whomsoever HE wills and 
      pleases.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
