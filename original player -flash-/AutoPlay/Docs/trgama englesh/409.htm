    <TD>42. Say, `Travel in the earth and see how evil was the end of those 
      before you. Most of them were idolaters.' <BR>43. So set thy face to the 
      service of the right religion, before there comes the day from ALLAH for 
      which there will be no averting. On that day believers and disbelievers 
      will be separated from each other. <BR>44. Those who disbelieve will bear 
      the consequences of their disbelief; and those who do righteous deeds 
      prepare good for their own souls, <BR>45. That HE, out of HIS bounty, may 
      reward those who believe and act righteously. Surely, HE loves not the 
      disbelievers. <BR>46. And of HIS Signs is that HE sends the winds as 
      bearers of glad tidings and that HE may make you taste of HIS mercy, and 
      that the ships may sail at HIS command, and that you may seek of HIS 
      bounty, and that you may be grateful. <BR>47. And, surely, WE sent 
      Messengers before thee to their own people, and they brought them clear 
      Signs. Then WE punished those who were guilty. And it was certainly 
      incumbent upon US to help the believers. <BR>48. It is ALLAH Who sends the 
      winds so that they raise the vapours in the form of a cloud. Then HE 
      spreads it in the sky as HE pleases, and then HE spreads it into 
      fragments, and thou seest the rain issuing forth from its midst. And when 
      HE causes it to fall on whom HE pleases of HIS servants, behold ! they 
      rejoice; <BR>49. Though before that - before it was sent down upon them 
      -they were in despair. <BR>50. Observe, then, the marks of ALLAH's mercy; 
      how HE quickens the earth after its death. Verily, it is HE Who quickens 
      the dead; for HE has power over all 
things.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
