    <TD>21. And when WE make people taste of mercy after adversity has touched 
      them, behold ! they begin to devise plans against Our Signs. Say, `ALLAH 
      is far swifter in planing.' Surely, Our Messengers write down all that you 
      plan. <BR>22. HE it is Who enables you to journey through land and sea 
      until when you are on board the ships and they sail with them with a fair 
      breeze and they rejoice in it, there overtakes them (the ships) a violent 
      wind and the waves come on them from every side and they think that they 
      are encompassed, then they call upon ALLAH, in sincere submission to HIM, 
      saying, `If thou deliver us from this, we will surely be of the thankful.' 
      <BR>23. But when HE delivered them, lo ! they begin to commit excesses in 
      the earth wrongfully. O ye people, your excesses in seeking the enjoyment 
      of the present life are only against your own selves. Then to US shall be 
      your return; and WE will inform you of what you used to do. <BR>24. The 
      likeness of the present life is only as water which WE sent down from the 
      clouds, then there mingles with it the produce of the earth, of which men 
      and cattle eat till when the earth takes on its ornament and looks 
      beautiful and its owners think that they have full power over it, there 
      comes to it by Our command by night or by day and WE render it like a mown 
      down field, as if nothing existed there the day before. Thus do WE expound 
      the Signs for a people who reflect. <BR>25. And ALLAH calls to the abode 
      of peace, and guides whom HE pleases to the straight 
  path.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
