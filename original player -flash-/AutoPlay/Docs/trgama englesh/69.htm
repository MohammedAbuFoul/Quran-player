    <TD>149. O ye who believe ! if you obey those who have disbelieved, they 
      will cause you to turn back on your heels, and you will become the losers. 
      <BR>150. Nay, ALLAH is your Protector, and HE is the Best of helpers. 
      <BR>151. And WE shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved 
      because they associate partners with ALLAH, for which HE has sent down no 
      authority. Their abode is the Fire; and evil is the habitation of the 
      wrongdoers. <BR>152. And ALLAH had surely made good to you HIS promise 
      when you were slaying and destroying them by HIS leave, until, when your 
      courage failed you and you disputed among yourselves concerning the order 
      and you disobeyed, after HE had shown you that which you love, HE withdrew 
      HIS help. Among you were those who desired the present world, and among 
      you were those who desired the Hereafter. Then HE turned you away from 
      them, that HE might try you - and HE has surely pardoned you, and ALLAH is 
      Gracious to the believers - <BR>153. When you were running away and looked 
      not back at anyone while the Messenger was calling you, in your rear, then 
      HE gave you one sorrow after another sorrow, that you might not grieve for 
      what escaped you nor for what befell you. And ALLAH is quite Aware of what 
      you do.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
