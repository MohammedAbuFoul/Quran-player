    <TD>34. And Joseph, indeed, came to you before with clear proofs, but you 
      ceased not to be in doubt concerning that which he came to you till, when 
      he died, you said, `ALLAH will never raise a Messenger after him.' Thus 
      does ALLAH adjudge as having gone astray every transgressor, doubter - 
      <BR>35. Those who dispute concerning the Signs of ALLAH without any 
      authority having come to them from ALLAH. Grievously hateful is this in 
      the Sight of ALLAH and in the sight of those who believe. Thus does ALLAH 
      set a seal upon the heart of every arrogant, haughty person. <BR>36. And 
      Pharaoh said, `O Haman, build thou for me a lofty tower that I may attain 
      to the means of access - <BR>37. `The means of access to the heavens, so 
      that I may have a look at the God of Moses, and I, surely, consider him to 
      be a liar.' And thus the evil of his conduct was made to look fair in the 
      eyes of Pharaoh, and he was barred from the right path; and the design of 
      Pharaoh was bound to end in ruin. <BR>38. And he who believed said, `O my 
      people follow me. I will guide you to the path of rectitude; <BR>39. `O my 
      people, this life of the world is but a temporary provision; and the 
      Hereafter is certainly the permanent abode; <BR>40. `Whoso does evil will 
      be requited only with the like of it; but whoso does good, whether male or 
      female, and is a believer - these will enter the Garden; they will be 
      provided therein without 
measure;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
