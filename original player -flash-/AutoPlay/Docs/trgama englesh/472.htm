    <TD>41. `And O my people, how strange it is that I call you to salvation, 
      and you call me to the Fire; <BR>42. `You invite me that I should 
      disbelieve in ALLAH and should associate with HIM that of which I have no 
      knowledge, while I invite you to the Mighty, the Great Forgiver; <BR>43. 
      `Surely, that to which you call me has no title to be called upon in this 
      world or in the Hereafter; and that our return is certainly to ALLAH and 
      that the transgressors will be the inmates of the Fire; <BR>44. `So you 
      will soon remember what I say to you. And I entrust my affair to ALLAH. 
      Verily, ALLAH watches over HIS servants.' <BR>45. So ALLAH preserved him 
      from the evils of whatever they plotted, and a grievous punishment 
      encompassed the people of Pharaoh - <BR>46. The Fire. They are exposed to 
      it morning and evening. And on the day when the appointed Hour is come, it 
      will be said to the angels, `Cast Pharaoh's people into the severest 
      punishment.' <BR>47. And when they will dispute with one another in the 
      Fire, the weak will say to those who were proud, `Verily, we were your 
      followers; will you then relieve us of a portion of the torment of the 
      Fire ?' <BR>48. Those, who were proud, will say, `Now, we are all in it. 
      ALLAH has already judged between HIS servants.' <BR>49. And those in the 
      Fire will say to the Keepers of Hell, `Pray to your Lord that HE may 
      lighten for us the punishment for a 
day.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
