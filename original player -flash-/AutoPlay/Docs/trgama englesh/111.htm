    <TD>18. The Jews and the Christians say, `We are the sons of ALLAH and HIS 
      beloved ones.' Say, `Why then does HE punish you for your sins ? Nay, you 
      are mortals from among those HE has created.' HE forgives whom HE pleases 
      and punishes whom HE pleases. And to ALLAH belongs the Kingdom of the 
      heavens and the earth and what is between them, and to HIM shall be the 
      final return. <BR>19. O People of the Book ! there indeed has come to you 
      Our Messenger, after a break in the series of Messengers, who makes things 
      clear to you lest you should say, `There has come to us no bearer of glad 
      tidings and no Warner.' So a bearer of glad tidings and a warner has 
      indeed come to you. And ALLAH has power over all things. <BR>20. And 
      remember when Moses said to his people, `O my people, call to mind ALLAH's 
      favour upon you when HE raised Prophets among you and made you kings, and 
      gave you what HE gave not to any other among the peoples; <BR>21. `O my 
      people, enter the Holy Land which ALLAH has ordained for you and do not 
      turn back, for then you will return as losers.' <BR>22. They said, `O 
      Moses, there is in that land an unruly and powerful people, and we shall 
      not enter it until they go forth from it, but if they go forth from it, 
      then we will enter it.' <BR>23. Thereupon two men from among those who 
      feared their Lord, on whom ALLAH has conferred HIS special favour, said 
      `Enter the gate advancing against them; when once you have entered it, 
      then surely you will be victorious. And put your trust in ALLAH, if you 
      are believers.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
