    <TD>1. Ta Sin Mim. <BR>2. These are verses of the Book that makes things 
      clear. <BR>3. Haply thou wilt grieve thyself to death because they believe 
      not. <BR>4. If WE please, WE can send down to them a Sign from the Heaven, 
      so that their necks will bow down before it. <BR>5. And there comes not to 
      them a new reminder from the Gracious God, but they turn away from it. 
      <BR>6. They have, indeed, treated it as a lie but soon there will come to 
      them the tidings of that at which they mocked. <BR>7. See they not the 
      earth, how many of every noble species have WE caused to grow therein ? 
      <BR>8. In that is a Sign indeed; but most of these would not believe. 
      <BR>9. And verily thy Lord - HE is the Mighty, the Merciful. <BR>10. And 
      call to mind when thy Lord called Moses, and directed him: `Go to the 
      wrongdoing people - <BR>11. `The people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear God 
      ? <BR>12. He said, `My Lord, I fear that they will reject me; <BR>13. `And 
      my breast is not straitened and my tongue is not fluent; so send word to 
      Aaron also; <BR>14. `And they have a charge against me, so I fear that 
      they will kill me.' <BR>15. God said, `That shall not be, go both of you 
      with Our Signs; We are with you hearing your prayers.' <BR>16. `So go to 
      Pharaoh and say, `We are the Messengers of the Lord of the Worlds <BR>17. 
      `To tell thee to send the children of Israel with us.' <BR>18. Pharaoh 
      said, `O Moses, did we not bring thee up among us as a child ? And thou 
      didst stay among us many years of thy life; <BR>19. `And thou didst do 
      that deed which thou didst, and thou art one of the 
  ungrateful.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
