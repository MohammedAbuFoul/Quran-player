    <TD>64. He said, `Can I trust you with him, except with the same result as 
      when I trusted you with his brother before. But ALLAH is the Best 
      Protector, And HE is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.' <BR>65. 
      And when they unpacked their goods, they found their money returned to 
      them. They said, `O our father, what more can we desire ? Here is our 
      money returned to us. We shall bring provision for our family, and guard 
      our brother and we shall have an extra measure of a camel-load. That is a 
      measure which is easy to obtain.' <BR>66. He said, `I will not send him 
      with you until you give me a solemn promise in the name of ALLAH that you 
      will surely bring him to me, unless it be that you are encompassed.' And 
      when they had given him their solemn promise, he said, `ALLAH watches over 
      what we say.' <BR>67. And he said, `O my sons, enter not by one gate, but 
      enter by different gates, and I can avail you naught against ALLAH. The 
      decision rest only with ALLAH. In HIM do I put my trust and in HIM let all 
      who would trust put their trust.' <BR>68. And when they entered in the 
      manner their father had commanded them, Jacob's purpose was fulfilled but 
      it could not avail them anything against ALLAH, except that there was a 
      desire in Jacob's mind which he thus satisfied; and he was surely 
      possessed of great knowledge WE had taught him, but most men know not. 
      <BR>69. And when they visited Joseph, he lodge his brother with himself. 
      And he said, `I am thy brother; so grieve not at they have been 
    doing.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
