    <TD>148. ALLAH likes not the uttering of unseemly speech in public, except 
      on the part of one who is being wronged. Verily, ALLAH is All-Hearing, 
      All-Knowing. <BR>149. Whether you make public a good deed or keep it 
      secret or pardon an evil, ALLAH is certainly the Effacer of sins, 
      All-Powerful. <BR>150. Surely, those who disbelieve in ALLAH and HIS 
      Messengers and seek to make a distinction between ALLAH and HIS 
      Messengers, and say, `We believe in some and disbelieve in others,' and 
      seek to take a way between; <BR>151. These really are the disbelievers, 
      and WE have prepared for the disbelievers an humiliating punishment. 
      <BR>152. And those who believe in ALLAH and in all his Messengers and make 
      no distinction between any of them, to such HE will soon give their 
      rewards. And ALLAH is Most Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>153. The people of the 
      Book ask thee to bring down upon them a Book from heaven. They asked Moses 
      a greater thing than this. They said, `Show us ALLAH openly.' Thereupon a 
      destructive punishment overtook them because of their transgression. Then 
      they took the calf for worship after clear Signs had come to them, but WE 
      pardoned even that. And WE gave Moses a manifest authority. <BR>154. And 
      WE raised high above them the Mount while making a covenant with them, and 
      WE said to them, `Enter the gate submissively,' and WE said to them, 
      `Transgress not in the matter of the Sabbath.' And WE took from them a 
      firm covenant.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
