    <TD>35. `No friend, therefore, has he here this day; <BR>36. `Nor any food 
      save the washing of wounds, <BR>37. `Which none but the sinners eat.' 
      <BR>38. But nay, I swear by that which you see, <BR>39. And that which you 
      see not. <BR>40. That it is, surely, the word brought by a noble 
      Messenger, <BR>41. And not the word of a poet; little is it what you 
      believe ! <BR>42. Nor is it the word of a soothsayer; little is it that 
      you heed ! <BR>43. It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds. <BR>44. 
      And if he had forged and attributed any sayings to US, <BR>45. We would, 
      surely, have seized him by the right hand, <BR>46. And then, surely, WE 
      would have cut his life-vein, <BR>47. And not one of you could have held 
      Our punishment off from him. <BR>48. And verily, it is a reminder for the 
      righteous, <BR>49. And, surely, WE know that there are some among you who 
      reject OUR Signs. <BR>50. And, verily, it will be a source of regret for 
      the disbelievers. <BR>51. And, surely, it is the absolute truth. <BR>52. 
      So glorify the name of thy Lord, the Great. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. An inquirer inquires concerning the punishment about to befall <BR>2. 
      The disbelievers, and which none can repel. <BR>3. It is from ALLAH, Lord 
      of great ascents. <BR>4. The angels and the Spirit ascend to HIM in a day, 
      the measure of which is fifty thousand years. <BR>5. So be patient with 
      admirable patience. <BR>6. They see it to be far off, <BR>7. But WE see it 
      to be nigh. <BR>8. The day when the heaven will become like molten copper, 
      <BR>9. And the mountains will become like flakes of wool, <BR>10. And a 
      friend will not inquire after a 
friend,&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
