    <TD>11. Say, `Verily, I am commanded to worship ALLAH with sincere 
      devotion, <BR>12. `And I am commanded to be the foremost of those who 
      submit to HIM.' <BR>13. Say, `Indeed I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the 
      punishment of a grievous day.' <BR>14. Say, `It is ALLAH I worship in 
      sincerest obedience to HIM. <BR>15. `As to you, worship what you like 
      beside HIM.' Say, `Surely, the real losers are they who ruin their souls 
      and their families on the day of Resurrection.' Beware ! that is, surely, 
      the manifest loss. <BR>16. They will have over them coverings of fire, and 
      beneath them similar coverings. It is this against which ALLAH warns HIS 
      servants. `O MY servants, take ME, then, for your Protector.' <BR>17. And 
      those who eschew the worship of false gods and turn to ALLAH - for them is 
      glad tidings. So give good tidings to MY servants. <BR>18. Who listen to 
      the Word and follow the best thereof. It is they whom ALLAH has guided, 
      and it is they who are really endowed with understanding. <BR>19. Can he, 
      then, against whom the sentence of punishment has become due, be saved ? 
      Canst thou rescue him who is in the Fire ? <BR>20. But for them who fear 
      their Lord, there are lofty mansions, built over lofty mansions, beneath 
      which streams flow. ALLAH has made that promise; and ALLAH breaks not HIS 
      promise. <BR>21. Hast thou not seen that ALLAH sends down water from the 
      sky, and causes it to flow in springs in the earth and then brings forth 
      thereby herbage of diverse hues ? Then it dries up and thou seest it turn 
      to yellow; then HE reduces it to broken straw. In that, verily, is a 
      reminder for men of 
understanding.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
