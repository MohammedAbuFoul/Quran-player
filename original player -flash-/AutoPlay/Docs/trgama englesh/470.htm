    <TD>26. Pharaoh said, `Leave me alone that I may slay Moses, and let him 
      call on his Lord. I fear lest he should change your religion or cause 
      disorder to appear in the land.' <BR>27. And Moses said, I take refuge 
      with my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant person who believes not in 
      the Day of Reckoning.' <BR>28. And a believing man from among the people 
      of Pharaoh, who kept hidden his faith, said, `Will you slay a man because 
      he says, `My Lord is ALLAH,' while he has also brought you clear proofs 
      from your Lord ? And if he be a liar, on him will be the sin of his lie; 
      but if he is truthful, then some of that which he threatens you with will, 
      surely, befall you. Certainly, ALLAH guides not one who exceeds the bounds 
      and is a great liar;' <BR>29. `O my people, yours is the sovereignty this 
      day, you being dominant in the land. But who will help us and protect us 
      from the punishment of ALLAH if it comes upon us ?' Pharaoh said, `I only 
      point out to you that which I see myself, and I guide you only to the path 
      of rectitude.' <BR>30. And he who believed said, `O my people, I fear for 
      you something like the day of destruction of the great peoples of the 
      past; <BR>31. `Like that which happened to the people of Noah, and the 
      tribes of Ad and Thamud and those after them. And ALLAH intends no 
      injustice to HIS servants: <BR>32. `And O my people, I fear for you the 
      day when people will call one another for help, <BR>33. `The day when you 
      shall turn back fleeing; and there will be no one to save you from ALLAH's 
      wrath. And for him whom ALLAH leaves to go astray, there shall be no 
      guide.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
