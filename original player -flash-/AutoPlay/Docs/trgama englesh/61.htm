    <TD>84. Say, `We believe in ALLAH and that which has been revealed to us, 
      and that which was revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and 
      the tribes, and in that which was given to Moses and Jesus and other 
      Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them and 
      to HIM we submit. <BR>85. And whoso seeks a religion other than Islam, it 
      shall not be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he shall be among the 
      losers. <BR>86. How shall ALLAH guide a people who have disbelieved after 
      believing and who had borne witness that the messenger was true and to 
      whom clear proofs had come ? And ALLAH guides not the wrong doing people. 
      <BR>87. As for such - their reward is that on them shall be the curse of 
      ALLAH and of angels and of men, all together. <BR>88. They shall abide 
      thereunder. Their punishment shall not be lightened nor shall they be 
      reprieved. <BR>89. Except those who repent thereafter and amend. And 
      surely ALLAH is Most Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>90. Surely those who 
      disbelieve after they have believed and then increase in their disbelief, 
      their repentance shall not be accepted, and these are they who have gone 
      astray. <BR>91. As for those who have disbelieved, and die while they are 
      disbelievers, there shall not be accepted from anyone of them even the 
      earth-full of gold though he offer it as ransom. It is these for whom 
      shall be a grievous punishment, and they shall have no 
  helpers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
