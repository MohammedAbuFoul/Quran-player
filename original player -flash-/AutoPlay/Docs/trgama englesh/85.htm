    <TD>38. And as for those who spend their wealth in order to be seen of 
      men, and believe not in ALLAH, nor the Last Day, they are the companions 
      of Satan, and whoso has Satan for a companion, and evil companion is he. 
      <BR>39. And what harm would have befallen them if they have believed in 
      ALLAH and the Last Day and spend out of what ALLAH has given them ? And 
      ALLAH knows them well. <BR>40. Surely, ALLAH wrongs not anyone even so 
      much as the weight of an atom. And if there be a good deed, HE multiplies 
      it and gives from Himself a great reward. <BR>41. And how will it fare 
      with them when WE shall bring a witness from every people, and shall bring 
      thee as a witness against these ! <BR>42. On that day those who 
      disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth were made 
      level with them, and they will not be able to hide anything from ALLAH. 
      <BR>43. O ye who believe ! go not near Prayer when you are not in full 
      possession of your senses, until you know what you are saying, nor when 
      you are unclean, except when you are traveling along a way, until you have 
      bathed. And if you are ill or you are on a journey while unclean, or if 
      one of you comes from the privy or you have touched women and you find no 
      water, then betake yourselves to pure dust and wipe therewith your faces 
      and your hands. Surely ALLAH is the Effacer of sins, Forgiving, <BR>44. 
      Hast thou not seen those who were given a portion of the Book ? They buy 
      error and desire that you too may lose the 
way.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
