    <TD>10. Those who disbelieve - their possessions and their children shall 
      not avail them at all against ALLAH; and it is they that are the fuel of 
      the Fire. <BR>11. Their case is the like the case of the people of Pharaoh 
      and those before them; They rejected our Signs; So ALLAH punished them for 
      their sins, and ALLAH is severe in punishing. <BR>12. Say to those who 
      disbelieve, `You shall be overcome and be gathered unto Hell; and an evil 
      place of rest it is.' <BR>13. Certainly there was for you a Sign in the 
      two armies which encountered each other - one army fighting in the way of 
      ALLAH and the other disbelieving, whom they saw with their own eyes to be 
      twice as many as themselves. Thus does ALLAH strengthen with HIS aid 
      whomsoever HE pleases. In that surely is a lesson for those who have eyes. 
      <BR>14. Fair-seeming to men is made the love of desired things -women and 
      children, and stored up heaps of gold and silver, and horses of mark and 
      cattle and crops. That is the provision of the present life; but it is 
      ALLAH with Whom is an excellent home. <BR>15. Say, `Shall I inform you of 
      something better than that ?' For those who fear God, there are Gardens 
      with their Lord; beneath which streams flow; therein shall they abide; and 
      pure mates and ALLAH's pleasure. And ALLAH is Mindful of HIS servants.
