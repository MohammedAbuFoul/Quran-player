    <TD>20. Did WE not create you from an insignificant fluid, <BR>21. And 
      placed it in a safe resting place, <BR>22. For a known measure of time ? 
      <BR>23. Thus did WE determine; and how excellent Determiner are WE ! 
      <BR>24. Woe on that day unto those who reject the Truth ! <BR>25. Have WE 
      not made the earth so as to hold <BR>26. The living and the dead ? <BR>27. 
      And WE placed therein high mountains, and gave you sweet water to drink. 
      <BR>28. Woe on that day unto those who reject the Truth ! <BR>29. They 
      will be commanded: `Now move on towards that which you treated as a lie, 
      <BR>30. `Aye, move on towards a three-pronged shadow, <BR>31. `Neither 
      affording shade, nor protecting from the blame.' <BR>32. It throws up 
      sparks like huge castles, <BR>33. As if they were tawny camels. <BR>34. 
      Woe on that day unto those who reject the Truth ! <BR>35. This is a day 
      when they shall not be able to speak, <BR>36. Nor shall they be permitted 
      to offer excuses. <BR>37. Woe on that day unto those who reject the Truth 
      ! <BR>38. This is the Day of Decision. WE have gathered you and all the 
      earlier peoples together; <BR>39. `If now you have any stratagem, try your 
      stratagem against me.' <BR>40. Woe on that day unto those who reject the 
      Truth ! <BR>41. The righteous will be in the midst of shades and springs, 
      <BR>42. And fruits such as they will desire. <BR>43. It will be said to 
      them, `Eat and drink pleasantly as a reward for what you did' - <BR>44. 
      Thus, surely, do WE reward those who do good. <BR>45. Woe on that day unto 
      those who reject the Truth ! <BR>46. Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little 
      while in this world, O rejectors of Truth, surely, you are the guilty 
      ones.' <BR>47. Woe on that day unto those who reject the Truth ! <BR>48. 
      And when it is said unto them, `Bow down,' they bow not down. <BR>49. Woe 
      on that day unto those who reject the Truth ! <BR>50. In what discourse 
      then, after this, will they believe
