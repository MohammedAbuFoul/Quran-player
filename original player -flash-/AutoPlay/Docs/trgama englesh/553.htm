    <TD>1. Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth glorifies 
      ALLAH, the Sovereign, the Holy, the Mighty, the Wise. <BR>2. HE it is Who 
      has raised among the unlettered people a Messenger from among themselves 
      who recites unto them HIS Signs, and purifies them, and teaches them the 
      Book and Wisdom though before that they were in manifest error; <BR>3. And 
      HE will raise him among others of them who have not yet joined them. HE is 
      the Mighty, the Wise. <BR>4. That is ALLAH's grace; HE bestows it on whom 
      HE pleases; and ALLAH is the Lord of immense grace. <BR>5. The likeness of 
      those who were charged with the Law of Torah, but did not carry out its 
      commandments, is as the likeness of an ass carrying a load of books. Evil 
      is the likeness of the people who reject the Signs of ALLAH. And ALLAH 
      guides not the wrongdoing people. <BR>6. Say, `O ye who are Jews, if you 
      claim that you are the friends of ALLAH to the exclusion of all other 
      peoples, then wish for death, if, indeed, you are truthful. <BR>7. But 
      they will never wish for it, because of that which their hands have sent 
      on before them. And ALLAH knows well those who do wrong. <BR>8. Say, `The 
      death from which you flee will, surely, overtake you. Then you will be 
      returned unto HIM Who knows the unseen and the seen and HE will inform you 
      of what you had been doing.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
