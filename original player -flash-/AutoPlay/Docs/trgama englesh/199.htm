    <TD>73. O Prophet ! strive hard against the disbelievers and the 
      Hypocrites. And be firm against them. Their abode is Hell, and evil 
      destination it is. <BR>74. They swear by ALLAH that they said nothing, but 
      they did certainly utter the word of disbelief, and disbelieved after they 
      had embraced Islam. And they designed what they could not attain. And they 
      cherished enmity against believers only because ALLAH and HIS Messenger 
      had enriched them out of HIS bounty. So if they repent, it will be better 
      for them; but if they turn away, ALLAH will punish them with a grievous 
      punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and they shall have neither 
      friend nor helper in the earth. <BR>75. And among them are those who made 
      a covenant with ALLAH, saying, `If HE give us of HIS bounty, we would most 
      surely give alms and be of the virtuous.' <BR>76. But when HE gave them 
      out of HIS bounty, they became niggardly of it, and turned away in 
      aversion. <BR>77. So HE requited them with hypocrisy which shall last in 
      their hearts until the day when they shall meet HIM, because they broke 
      their promise, and because they lied. <BR>78. Know they not that ALLAH 
      knows their hidden thoughts as well as their secret counsels and that 
      ALLAH knows full well all unseen things ? <BR>79. These hypocrites are 
      those who find fault with such of the believers as give freely in charity 
      and with such as find nothing to give save the earnings of their toil. So 
      they deride them. ALLAH shall punish them for their derision, and for them 
      is a grievous punishment.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
