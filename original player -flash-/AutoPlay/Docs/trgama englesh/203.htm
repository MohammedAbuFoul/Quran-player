    <TD>100. And as for the foremost among the believers, the first of the 
      Emigrants and the Helpers, and those who followed them in the best 
      possible manner, ALLAH is well-pleased with them and they are well-pleased 
      with HIM, and HE has prepared for them Gardens underneath which streams 
      flow. They will abide therein for ever. That is the supreme triumph. 
      <BR>101. And of the desert Arabs around you some are hypocrites; and of 
      the people of Medina also. They persist in hypocrisy. Thou knowest them 
      not; WE know them. WE will punish them twice; then they shall be given 
      over to a great punishment. <BR>102. And there are others who confessed 
      their faults. They mixed good works with others that are evil. It may be 
      that ALLAH will turn to them with compassion. Surely, ALLAH is Most 
      Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>103. Take alms out of their wealth, so that thou 
      mayest cleanse them and purify them thereby. And pray for them; thy prayer 
      indeed is a source of tranquility for them. And ALLAH is All-Knowing. 
      <BR>104. Know they not that ALLAH is HE Who accepts repentance from HIS 
      servants and take alms, and that ALLAH is HE Who is Oft-Returning with 
      compassion, and is Merciful ? <BR>105. And say, `Go on working and ALLAH 
      will surely watch your conduct and also HIS Messenger and the believers. 
      And you shall be brought back to HIM Who knows the unseen and the seen; 
      the HE will inform you of what you did.' <BR>106. And there are others 
      whose case has been postponed pending the decree of ALLAH. HE may punish 
      them or HE may turn to them with compassion. And ALLAH is All-Knowing, 
      Wise.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
