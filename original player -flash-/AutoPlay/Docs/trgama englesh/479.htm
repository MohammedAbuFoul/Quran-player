    <TD>21. And they will say to their skins, `Why have you borne witness 
      against us ?' They will say, `ALLAH has made us speak as HE has made 
      everything else speak. And HE it is Who created you the first time, and 
      unto HIM have you been brought back. <BR>22. `And you did not apprehend, 
      while committing sins, that your ears and your eyes and your skins would 
      bear witness against you; nay, you thought that even ALLAH did not know 
      much of what you used to do. <BR>23. `And that thought of yours, which you 
      entertained concerning your Lord, has ruined you. So now you have become 
      of those who are lost.' <BR>24. Now if they can endure, the Fire is their 
      abode; and if they ask for favour, they are not of those whom favour will 
      be shown. <BR>25. And we had assigned to them companions who made to 
      appear attractive to them what was before them and what was behind them of 
      their deeds, and the same sentence was proved true concerning them as had 
      proved true concerning the communities of jinn and men that had gone 
      before them. Surely, they were the losers. <BR>26. And those who 
      disbelieve say, `Listen not to this Qur'an, but make noise during its 
      recital that you may have the upper hand.' <BR>27. And, most certainly, WE 
      will make those who disbelieve taste a severe punishment, and, most 
      certainly, WE will requite them for the worst of their deeds. <BR>28. That 
      is the reward of the enemies of ALLAH - the Fire. For them there will be 
      an abiding home therein as a requital because they persisted in denying 
      Our Signs. <BR>29. And those who disbelieve will say, `Our Lord, show us 
      those who led us astray from among both the jinn and men, that we may 
      trample them under our feet so that they may be 
  abased.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
