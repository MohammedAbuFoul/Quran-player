      doing ? <BR>113. `Their account is only with my Lord, if you only knew; 
      <BR>114. `And I am not going to drive away the believers; <BR>115. `I am 
      only a plain Warner.' <BR>116. They said, `If thou desist not, O Noah, 
      thou shalt surely be stoned to death.' <BR>117. He said, `My Lord, my 
      people have treated me as a liar; <BR>118. `Therefore judge Thou 
      decisively between me and them; and save me and the believers that are

      every high place, seeking vain glory ? <BR>129. `And do you erect palaces 
      as if you will live for ever ? <BR>130. `And when you lay hands upon 
      anyone, you lay hands as tyrants. <BR>131. `So fear ALLAH and obey me; 
      <BR>132. `And fear HIM Who has helped you with all that you know; <BR>133. 
      `He has helped you with cattle and sons, <BR>134. `And gardens and 
      springs; <BR>135. `Indeed I fear for you the punishment of an awful day.'
