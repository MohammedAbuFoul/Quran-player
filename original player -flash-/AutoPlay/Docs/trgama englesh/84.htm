    <TD>34. Men are guardians over women because ALLAH has made some of them 
      excel others, and because men spend on them of their wealth. So virtuous 
      women are obedient, and guard the secrets of their husbands with ALLAH's 
      protection. And as for those on whose part you fear disobedience, admonish 
      them and keep away from them in their beds and chastise them. Then if they 
      obey you, seek not a way against them. Surely, ALLAH is High and Great. 
      <BR>35. And if you fear a breach between them, then appoint an arbiter 
      from his folk and an arbiter from her folk. If they (the arbiters) desire 
      reconciliation, ALLAH will effect it between them. Surely, ALLAH is 
      All-Knowing, All-Aware. <BR>36. And worship ALLAH and associate naught 
      with HIM, and show kindness to parents, and to kindred, and orphans, and 
      the needy, and to the neighbour who is a kinsman and the neighbour who is 
      a stranger, and the companion by your side, and the wayfarer, and those 
      whom your right hands possess. Surely, ALLAH loves not the arrogant and 
      the boastful; <BR>37. Who are niggardly and also enjoin people to be 
      niggardly, and hide that which ALLAH has given them of HIS bounty. And WE 
      have prepared for the disbelievers an humiliating 
  punishment;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
