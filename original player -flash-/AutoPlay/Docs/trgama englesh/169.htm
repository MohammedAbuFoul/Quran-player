    <TD>150. And when Moses returned to his people, indignant and grieved, he 
      said, `Evil is that which you did in my place in my absence. Did you 
      hasten to devise a way for yourselves without waiting for the command of 
      your Lord ?' And he put down the tablet and seized his brother by the 
      head, dragging him towards himself. Aaron said, `Son of my mother, the 
      people indeed deemed me weak, and were about to kill me. Therefore make 
      not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune and place me not with the 
      unjust people.' <BR>151. Moses said, `My Lord, forgive me and my brother, 
      and admit us to Thy mercy and Thou art the Most Merciful of those who show 
      mercy.' <BR>152. As to those, who took the calf for worship, wrath from 
      their Lord shall overtake them and abasement in the present life. And thus 
      do WE reward those who invent lies. <BR>153. And those who do evil deeds 
      and repent and believe, surely, thy Lord after that is Most Forgiving, 
      Merciful. <BR>154. And when the anger of Moses subsided, he took the 
      tablets and in their writing there was guidance and mercy for those who 
      fear their Lord. <BR>155. And Moses chose of his people seventy men for 
      Our appointment. But when the earthquake overtook them, he said, `My Lord 
      , if Thou hadst pleased, Thou couldst have destroyed them before this, and 
      me too. Wilt Thou destroy us for that which the foolish among us have done 
      ? This is nothing but a trial from Thee. Thou causest to perish thereby 
      whom Thou pleasest and Thou guidest whom Thou pleasest. Thou art our 
      Protector; forgive us then and have mercy upon us and Thou art the Best of 
      those who forgive;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
