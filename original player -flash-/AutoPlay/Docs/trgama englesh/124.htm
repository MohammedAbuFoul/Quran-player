    <TD>96. The game of the sea and the eating thereof is made lawful for you 
      as a provision for you and the travelers; but forbidden to you is the game 
      of the land as long as you are in the state of Pilgrimage. And fear ALLAH 
      to whom you shall be gathered. <BR>97. ALLAH has made the Ka'bah the 
      Sacred House, a means of support and uplift for mankind, as also the 
      Sacred Month and the offerings and the animals with collars. That is so 
      that you may know that ALLAH knows what is in the heavens and what is in 
      the earth, and that ALLAH knows all things well. <BR>98. Know that ALLAH 
      is Severe in punishment and that ALLAH is also Most Forgiving and ever 
      Merciful. <BR>99. On the Messenger lies only the conveying of the Message. 
      And ALLAH knows what you disclose and what you hide. <BR>100. Say, `The 
      bad and the good are not alike,' even though the abundance of bad may 
      please thee. So be mindful of your duty to ALLAH, O men of understanding, 
      that you may prosper. <BR>101. O ye who believe ! ask not about things 
      which, if revealed to you, would cause you trouble, though if you ask 
      about them while the Qur'an is being sent down they will be revealed to 
      you. ALLAH has left them out on purpose. And ALLAH is Most Forgiving and 
      Forbearing. <BR>102. A people before you asked about such things, but then 
      they became disbelievers therein. <BR>103. ALLAH has not ordained any 
      `Bahira' or `Sa'ibah' or Wasilah' or `Hami' but those who disbelieve forge 
      a lie against ALLAH, and most of them do not make use of their 
      understanding.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
