    <TD>184. `And fear HIM Who created you and the earlier peoples.' <BR>185. 
      They said, `Thou art but a bewitched person, <BR>186. `And thou art only a 
      mortal like us, and we believe thee to be a liar; <BR>187. `So cause 
      fragments of the sky to fall on us, if thou art truthful.' <BR>188. He 
      said, `My Lord knows best what you do.' <BR>189. So they rejected him. 
      Then the punishment of the day of overshadowing gloom overtook them. That 
      was indeed the punishment of a dreadful day. <BR>190. In that, verily, 
      there is a Sign; but most of these would not believe. <BR>191. And surely 
      thy Lord - HE is the Mighty, the Merciful. <BR>192. And verily this Qur'an 
      is a revelation from the Lord of all the worlds. <BR>193. The Spirit, 
      faithful to the trust, has descended with it <BR>194. On thy heart, that 
      thou mayest be a Warner, <BR>195. In plain and clear Arabic tongue. 
      <BR>196. And it is surely mentioned in the scriptures of the former 
      peoples. <BR>197. And is it not a sufficient Sign for them that the 
      learned among the Children of Israel know it ? <BR>198. And if WE had sent 
      it down to one of the non-Arabs, <BR>199. And he had read it to them, they 
      would never have believed in it. <BR>200. Thus have WE caused disbelief to 
      enter into the hearts of the sinful. <BR>201. They will not believe in it 
      until they see the grievous punishment. <BR>202. Which will come upon them 
      suddenly, while they are not aware of it. <BR>203. And they will say, 
      `Shall we be respited ?' <BR>204. What ! do they seek to hasten OUR 
      punishment ? <BR>205. What thinkest thou that if WE let them enjoy the 
      good things of this world for years; <BR>206. Then there comes to them the 
      punishment that they are 
promised,&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
