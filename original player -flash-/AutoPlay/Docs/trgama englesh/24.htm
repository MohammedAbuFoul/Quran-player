    <TD>154. And say not of those who are slain in the way of ALLAH that they 
      are dead; nay they are living, only you perceive not. <BR>155. And WE will 
      try you with something of fear and hunger, and loss of wealth and lives 
      and fruits; but give glad tidings to those who patiently 
      persevere.<BR>156. Who, when a misfortune overtakes them, say, `Surely, to 
      ALLAH we belong and to HIM shall we return.' <BR>157. It is these on whom 
      descend blessings from their Lord and also mercy, and it is these that are 
      rightly guided.<BR>158. Surely, Al-Safa and Al-Marwah are among the Signs 
      of ALLAH. It is therefore no sin for him who is on Pilgrimage to the 
      House, or performs Umrah, or go around the two. And whoso does good beyond 
      what is obligatory, surely then, ALLAH is appreciative of good deeds, and 
      All-Knowing. <BR>159. Those who hide what WE have sent down of Signs and 
      guidance after WE have made it clear for the people in the Book, it is 
      these whom ALLAH curses; so curse them those who have the right to 
      curse.<BR>160. But they who repent and amend and openly declare the truth, 
      it is these to whom I turn with forgiveness, and I am Oft-Returning with 
      compassion and Merciful. <BR>161. Those who disbelieve and die while they 
      are disbelievers, on them shall be the curse of ALLAH and of the angels 
      and of men all together. <BR>162. They shall remain under it. The 
      punishment shall not be lightened for them, nor shall they be granted 
      respite. <BR>163. And your God is One God; there is no God but HE, the 
      Gracious, the Merciful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
