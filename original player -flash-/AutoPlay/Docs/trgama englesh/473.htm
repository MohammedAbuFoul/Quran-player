    <TD>50. The Keepers will say, `Did not your Messengers come to you with 
      manifest Signs ?' They will say, `Yea.' The Keepers will say, `Then pray 
      on.' but the prayer of disbelievers is of no avail. <BR>51. Most, surely, 
      we help Our Messengers and those who believe, both in the present life and 
      on the day when the witnesses will stand forth, <BR>52. The day when their 
      pleading will not profit the wrongdoers, and for them will be the curse 
      and for them will be the evil abode. <BR>53. And, indeed, WE gave Moses 
      the guidance, and made the children of Israel heirs to the Book - <BR>54. 
      A guidance and a Reminder for men of understanding. <BR>55. So have 
      patience. Surely, the promise of ALLAH is true. And ask forgiveness for 
      them for the wrongs they have done thee and glorify thy Lord with HIS 
      praise in the evening and the in morning. <BR>56. Those who dispute 
      concerning the Signs of ALLAH without any authority having come to them 
      from ALLAH - there is nothing in their breasts but an ambition to become 
      great which they will never attain. So seek refuge in ALLAH. Surely, HE is 
      the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. <BR>57. Certainly, the creation of the 
      heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of mankind; but most 
      men know not. <BR>58. And the blind and the seeing are not equal; neither 
      are those who believe and do good deeds equal to those who do evil. Little 
      do you reflect.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
