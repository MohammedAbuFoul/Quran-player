    <TD>7. And by the heaven full of tracks, <BR>8. Truly you at variance in 
      what you say. <BR>9. He alone is turned away from the truth who is decreed 
      to be turned away. <BR>10. Cursed be the liars, <BR>11. Who are heedless 
      of truth in the depths of ignorance. <BR>12. They ask, when will the Day 
      of Judgment be ?' <BR>13. Say, `It will be the day when they will be 
      tormented with the torment of the Fire.' <BR>14. And it will be said to 
      them, `Taste ye your torment. This is what you asked to be hastened.' 
      <BR>15. But surely, the righteous will be in the midst of gardens and 
      springs, <BR>16. Taking what their Lord will bestow upon them; for they 
      used to do good before that; <BR>17. They slept but a little of the night; 
      <BR>18. And at dawn they prayed for divine pardon; <BR>19. And in their 
      wealth was a share for those who asked for help and for those who could 
      not. <BR>20. And in the earth are Signs for those who have certainty of 
      faith, <BR>21. And also in your ownselves. Will you not then see ? <BR>22. 
      And in heaven is your sustenance, and also that which you are promised. 
      <BR>23. And by the Lord of the heaven and the earth it is certainly the 
      truth, just as it is true that you speak. <BR>24. Has the story of 
      Abraham's honoured guests reached thee ? <BR>25. When they came to him and 
      said, `Peace !' he said in reply, `On you be peace.' He thought that they 
      were strangers. <BR>26. And he went quietly to his household, and brought 
      a fatted calf, <BR>27. And he placed it before them and said, `Will you 
      not eat ?' <BR>28. And he conceived a fear of them. They said, `Fear not.' 
      And they gave him glad tidings of the birth of a son who would be blessed 
      with knowledge. <BR>29. Then his wife came forward extremely embarrassed 
      and smote her face and said, `I am but a barren old woman !' <BR>30. They 
      said, `Even so has thy Lord said. Surely, HE is the Wise, the 
      All-Knowing.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
