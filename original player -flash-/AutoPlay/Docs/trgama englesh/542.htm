          <TD>1. ALLAH has, indeed, heard the talk of her who pleads with thee 
            concerning her husband, and complains unto ALLAH. And ALLAH has 
            heard the two of you conversing together. Verily, ALLAH is 
            All-Hearing, All-Seeing. <BR>2. Those among you who put away their 
            wives by calling them mothers - they do not thereby become their 
            mothers ; their mothers are only those who gave them birth. They 
            certainly utter words that are manifestly evil and untrue; but, 
            surely, ALLAH is the Effacer of sins, Most Forgiving. <BR>3. Those 
            who put away their wives by calling them mothers, and then would go 
            back on what they have said, must free a slave before they touch one 
            another. This is what you are admonished with. And ALLAH is 
            Well-Aware of what you do. <BR>4. But he who does not find a slave, 
            he must fast for two consecutive months, before they touch one 
            another. And he who is not able to do so shall feed sixty poor 
            people. This is enjoined on you so that you may have faith in ALLAH 
            and HIS Messenger. And these are the limits prescribed by ALLAH; and 
            for the disbelievers is a painful punishment. <BR>5. Those who 
            oppose ALLAH and HIS Messenger will, surely be abased even as those 
            before them were abased; and WE have already sent down clear Signs. 
            And the disbelievers will have an humiliating punishment, <BR>6. On 
            the day when ALLAH will raise them all together. And HE will inform 
            them of what they did. ALLAH has kept account of it, while they have 
            forgotten it. And ALLAH is Witness over all 
        things.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
