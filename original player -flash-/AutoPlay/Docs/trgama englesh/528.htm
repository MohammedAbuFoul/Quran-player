    <TD>45. And that HE creates the pairs, male and female, <BR>46. From a 
      sperm drop when it is emitted; <BR>47. And that it is for him to bring 
      forth the second creation; <BR>48. And that it is HE Who enriches and 
      gives contentment; <BR>49. And that HE is the Lord of Sirius. <BR>50. And 
      that HE destroyed the first tribe of Ad, <BR>51. And the tribe of Thamud 
      and HE spared no one, <BR>52. And HE destroyed the people of Noah before 
      them - verily, they were most unjust and most rebellious - <BR>53. And HE 
      overthrew the subverted cities of the people of Lot, <BR>54. So that there 
      covered them that which covered. <BR>55. Which, then, O man, of the 
      bounties of thy Lord wilt thou dispute ? <BR>56. This Messenger of Ours is 
      a Warner like the Warners of Old. <BR>57. The Hour of Judgment which was 
      to come has drawn nigh, <BR>58. None but ALLAH can avert it. <BR>59. Do 
      you, then, wonder at this announcement ? <BR>60. And do you laugh and weep 
      not, <BR>61. While you make merry ? <BR>62. So prostrate yourselves before 
      ALLAH and worship HIM. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. The Hour has drawn nigh, and the moon is rent asunder. <BR>2. And if 
      they see a Sign, they turn away and say, `An oft-repeated sorcery.' <BR>3. 
      They have rejected the truth and follow their own fancies. But for 
      everything there is an appointed time. <BR>4. And there has already come 
      to them accounts of events containing warnings - <BR>5. Consummate wisdom; 
      but the warnings profit them not. <BR>6. Therefore, turn thou away from 
      them and await the day when the Summoner will summon them to a 
      disagreeable thing,&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
