    <TD>25. And WE sent no Messenger before thee but WE revealed to him: 
      `There is no god but I; so worship ME alone.' <BR>26. And they say, `The 
      Gracious God has taken to Himself a son.' Holy is HE. Nay, those whom they 
      so designate are only HIS honoured servants; <BR>27. They speak not before 
      HE speaks, and they only carry out HIS commands. <BR>28. HE knows what is 
      before them and what is behind them, and they intercede not except for him 
      whom HE approves it and they tremble in awe of HIM. <BR>29. And whosoever 
      of them should say, `I am a god beside HIM,' him shall WE requite with 
      Hell. Thus do WE requite the wrongdoers. <BR>30. Do not the disbelievers 
      see that the heavens and the earth were a closed up-mass, then WE opened 
      them out ? And WE made of water every living thing. Will they not then 
      believe ? <BR>31. And WE have placed in the earth firm mountains lest it 
      should quake with them; and WE have made therein wide pathways, that they 
      may be rightly guided. <BR>32. And WE have made the heaven a roof, 
      well-protected, yet they turn away from its Signs. <BR>33. And HE it is 
      Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, each gliding 
      along smoothly in its orbit. <BR>34. WE granted not everlasting life to 
      any mortal before thee. If they shouldst die, shall they live here for 
      ever ? <BR>35. Every soul shall taste of death; and WE test you with evil 
      and good by way of trial. And to US shall you be 
  returned.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
