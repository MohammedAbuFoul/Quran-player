    <TD>105. And, in accordance with the requirements of truth and wisdom WE 
      have sent it down, and with truth and wisdom has it descended. And WE have 
      sent thee only as a bearing of good tidings and a Warner. <BR>106. And WE 
      have divided the Qur'an in parts that thou mayest read it to mankind 
      slowly and at intervals and WE have sent it down piecemeal. <BR>107. Say, 
      `Whether you believe therein or believe not, those to whom knowledge has 
      been given before it, do fall down prostrate on their faces when it is 
      recited to them. <BR>108. And say, `Holy is our Lord. Surely, the promise 
      of our Lord is bound to be fulfilled.' <BR>109. They fall down on their 
      faces weeping, and it increases humility in them. <BR>110. Say, `Call upon 
      ALLAH or call upon Al-Rahman, by whichever name you call on HIM, HIS are 
      the most beautiful names.' And utter not thy Prayer aloud, nor utter it 
      too low, but seek a way between. <BR>111. And say, `All praise belongs to 
      ALLAH who has taken unto Himself no son, and who has no partner in HIS 
      kingdom, nor has HE anyone to help HIM because of any weakness of HIS.' 
      And proclaim HIS greatness, glorifying HIM. <BR>&nbsp;
      <HR width="90%" color=#000000 SIZE=3>
      1. All praise belongs to ALLAH WHO has sent down the Book to HIS servant, 
      and has not placed therein any crookedness. <BR>2. HE has made it a 
      guardian, that it may give warning of a severe chastisement from HIM, and 
      that it may give the believers, who do good works, the glad tidings that 
      they shall have a goodly reward, <BR>3. Wherein they will abide forever; 
      <BR>4. And that it may warn those who say, `ALLAH has taken unto Himself a 
      son.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
