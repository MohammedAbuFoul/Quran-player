    <TD>8. It may be that your Lord will now have mercy on you; but if you 
      return to mischief, WE too will return to punishment, and remember WE have 
      made Hell a prison for the disbelievers. <BR>9. Surely, this Qur'an guides 
      to what is most right; and gives to the believers who do good deeds the 
      glad tidings that they shall have a great reward; <BR>10. And warns that 
      for those who do not believe in the Hereafter WE have prepared a grievous 
      punishment. <BR>11. And man prays for evil as he should pray for good; and 
      man is very hasty. <BR>12. And WE have made the night and the day two 
      Signs, and the Sign of the night WE have made dark, and the Sign of the 
      day WE have made sight-giving, that you make seek bounty from your Lord, 
      and that you may know the computation of years and the process of 
      reckoning. And everything WE have explained with a detailed explanation. 
      <BR>13. And every man's work have WE fasten to his neck; and on the Day of 
      Resurrection WE shall bring out for him a book which he will find wide 
      open. <BR>14. It will be said to him, `Read thy book. Sufficient is thy 
      own soul as a reckoner against thee this day.' <BR>15. He who follows the 
      right way follows it only for the good of his own soul; and he who goes 
      astray, goes astray only to his own loss. And no bearer of burden shall 
      bear the burden of another. And WE shall never punish until WE have sent a 
      Messenger. <BR>16. And when WE intend to destroy a township, WE command 
      its people who live in comfort to adopt the way of righteousness but they 
      transgress therein, so the sentence of punishment becomes due against it, 
      so WE destroy it with utter destruction. <BR>17. How many generations did 
      WE destroy after Noah ! and thy Lord suffices as Knower and Seer of the 
      sins of HIS servants.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
