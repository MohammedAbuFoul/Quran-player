    <TD>27. And WE have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is 
      between them in vain. That is the view of those who disbelieve. Woe, then, 
      to the disbelievers because of the punishment of the Fire that shall 
      overtake them. <BR>28. Shall WE treat those who believe and do good works 
      like those who act corruptly in the earth ? Shall WE treat the righteous 
      like the wicked ? <BR>29. This is a Book which WE have revealed to thee, 
      full of excellences, that they may reflect over its verses, and that those 
      gifted with understanding may take heed. <BR>30. And WE bestowed on David 
      Solomon who was an excellent servant of Ours. He was always turning to US. 
      <BR>31. When there were brought before him at eventide steeds of noblest 
      breed and swift of foot, <BR>32. He said, `I love the love of good things 
      because they remind me of my Lord.' And when they were hidden behind the 
      veil, <BR>33. He said, `Bring them back to me.' Then he started stroking 
      their legs and their necks. <BR>34. Certainly, WE tried Solomon and WE 
      placed on his throne a mere body. Then he turned to God, seeking his 
      mercy. <BR>35. He said, `O my Lord, grant me forgiveness and bestow on me 
      a kingdom that may not be inherited by anyone after me; surely, Thou art 
      the Great Bestower.' <BR>36. So WE subjected to him the wind, blowing 
      gently by his command withersoever he would go, <BR>37. And the giants, 
      all sorts of architects and builders, and divers, <BR>38. And others bound 
      in fetters. <BR>39. `This is Our gift - so give freely or withhold - 
      without reckoning.' <BR>40. And certainly he had a position of nearness 
      with US and an excellent resort. <BR>41. And remember Our servant Job, 
      when he cried unto his Lord; `Satan has afflicted me with toil and 
      torment.' <BR>42. WE directed him: `Urge thy riding beast with thy foot 
      and depart swiftly. Yonder is cool water to wash with, and a 
    drink.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
