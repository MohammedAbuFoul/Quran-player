    <TD>127. And remember the time when Abraham and Ishmael raised the 
      foundations of the house, praying, `Our Lord, accept this from us; for 
      thou art the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing;<BR>128. `Our Lord, make us both 
      submissive to THEE and make of our offspring a people submissive to THEE. 
      And show us our ways of worship and turn to us with mercy; for thou art 
      Oft-Returning with compassion, and art Merciful. <BR>129. `And, Our Lord, 
      raise up among them a Messenger from among themselves who may recite to 
      them THY Signs and teach them the Book and Wisdom and may purify them; 
      surely Thou art the Mighty the Wise. <BR>130. And who will turn away from 
      the religion of Abraham but he who makes a fool of himself. Him did we 
      choose in this world, and in the next he will surely be among the 
      righteous. <BR>131. When his Lord said to Him, `Submit', he said, `I have 
      already submitted to the Lord of the worlds.' <BR>132. The same did 
      Abraham enjoin upon his sons, - and Jacob also - saying, `O my sons, truly 
      ALLAH has chosen this religion for you; so let not death overtake you 
      except when you are in a state of complete submission.' <BR>133. Were you 
      present when death came to Jacob, when he said to his sons. `What will you 
      worship after me ?' They answered, `We will worship thy God, the God of 
      thy fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac, the One God; and to HIM we 
      submit ourselves.' <BR>134. Those are a people that have passed away, for 
      them is that which they have earned, and for you is what you earn, and you 
      shall not be questioned as to what they 
did.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
