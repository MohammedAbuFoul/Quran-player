    <TD>71. And they imagined that no punishment would result from their 
      conduct, so they became blind and deaf. But ALLAH turned to them in mercy; 
      yet again many of them became blind and deaf; and ALLAH is Watchful of 
      what they do. <BR>72. Indeed, they are disbelievers who say, `ALLAH, HE is 
      the Messiah, son of Mary,' whereas the Messiah himself said, `O Children 
      of Israel, worship ALLAH Who is my Lord and your Lord.' Surely, whoso 
      associates partners with ALLAH, him has ALLAH forbidden Heaven, and the 
      Fire will be his resort. And the wrongdoers shall have no helpers. <BR>73. 
      They surely disbelieve who say, `ALLAH is the third of three;' there is no 
      god but the One God. And if they do not desist from what they say, a 
      grievous punishment shall surely befall those of them that disbelieve. 
      <BR>74. Will they not then turn to ALLAH and ask HIS forgiveness, while 
      ALLAH is Most Forgiving and Merciful ? <BR>75. The Messiah, son of Mary, 
      was only a Messenger; surely Messengers like unto him had passed away 
      before him. And his mother was a truthful woman. They both used to eat 
      food. See how WE explain the Signs for their good, and see how they are 
      turned away. <BR>76. Say, `Will you worship beside ALLAH that which has no 
      power to do you harm or good ? And ALLAH is All-Hearing, 
  All-Knowing.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
