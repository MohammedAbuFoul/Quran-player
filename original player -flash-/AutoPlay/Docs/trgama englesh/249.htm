    <TD>1. Alif Lam Mim Ra. These are the verses of the perfect Book. That 
      which has been revealed to thee from thy Lord is the truth, but most men 
      believe not. <BR>2. ALLAH is HE Who raised up the heavens without any 
      pillars that you can see. Then HE settled HIMSELF on the Throne. And HE 
      pressed the sun and the moon into your service; each planet pursues its 
      course until an appointed term. HE regulates all affairs and HE clearly 
      explains the Signs that you may have firm belief in the meeting with your 
      Lord. <BR>3. And HE it is Who spread out the earth and made therein 
      mountains and rivers, and of fruits of every kind HE made therein two 
      sexes. HE causes the night to cover the day. Therein, verily, are Signs 
      for a people who reflect. <BR>4. And in the earth are diverse tracks, 
      adjoining one another, and gardens of vines, and corn-fields, and 
      date-palms, growing together from one root and others not so growing, they 
      are all watered with the same water, yet WE make some of them excel others 
      in fruit. Therein are Signs for a people who use their understanding. 
      <BR>5. And if thou shouldst wonder at their saying, `What ! when we have 
      become dust, shall we then be in a state of new creation,' then wondrous 
      indeed is what they say. These it is who disbelieve in their Lord; and 
      these it is who shall have shackles round their necks, and they shall be 
      the inmates of the Fire, wherein they shall 
abide.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
