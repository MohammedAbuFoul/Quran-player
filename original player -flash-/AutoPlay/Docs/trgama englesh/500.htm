    <TD>14. Tell those who believe to forgive those who persecute them and 
      fear not the Days of ALLAH, that HE may requite a people for what they 
      earn. <BR>15. Whoso does a good deed, does it for his own soul; and whoso 
      does wrong, does so to its detriment. Then to your Lord will you all be 
      brought back. <BR>16. And verily, WE gave the Children of Israel the Book 
      and sovereignty and Prophethood; and WE provided them with good and pure 
      things, and WE exalted them over the peoples of their time. <BR>17. And WE 
      gave them clear Signs regarding this Affair. And they did not differ but 
      after true knowledge had come to them, through mutual envy. Verily, thy 
      Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that 
      wherein they differed. <BR>18. Then WE set thee on a clear path concerning 
      the Affair; so follow it, and follow not the vain desires of those who do 
      not know. <BR>19. Verily, they will not avail thee aught against ALLAH. 
      Surely, the wrongdoers are friends, one of another; but ALLAH is the 
      friend of the righteous. <BR>20. This Book contains clear evidences for 
      mankind and is a guidance and a mercy for a people who possess firm faith. 
      <BR>21. Do those who commit evil deeds imagine that WE shall make them 
      like those who believe and do righteous deeds, so that their life and 
      their death shall be equal ? Evil, indeed, is what they judge. <BR>22. And 
      ALLAH has created the heavens and the earth in accordance with an eternal 
      law, so that every soul may be requited for that which it earns; and they 
      shall not be wronged.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
