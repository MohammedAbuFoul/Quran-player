    <TD>44. ALLAH alternates the night and the day. Therein, surely, is a 
      lesson for those who have eyes. <BR>45. And ALLAH has created every animal 
      from water. Of them are some that go upon their bellies, and of them are 
      some that go upon two feet, and among them are some that go upon four. 
      ALLAH creates what HE pleases. Surely, ALLAH has the power to do all that 
      HE pleases. <BR>46. WE have indeed sent down manifest Signs. And ALLAH 
      guides whom HE pleases to the right path. <BR>47. And they say, `We 
      believe in ALLAH and in the Messenger, and we obey;' then after that some 
      of them turn away. Such are not believers at all. <BR>48. And when they 
      are called to ALLAH and HIS Messenger that he may judge between them, lo ! 
      a party of them turn away. <BR>49. And if they consider the right to be on 
      their side, they come to him running in submission. <BR>50. Is it that 
      there is a disease in their hearts ? Or, do they doubt, or do they fear 
      that ALLAH and HIS Messenger will be unjust to them ? Nay, it is they 
      themselves who are the wrongdoers. <BR>51. All that the believers say, 
      when they are called to ALLAH and HIS Messenger in order that he may judge 
      between them, is that they say, `We hear and we obey.' And it is they who 
      will prosper. <BR>52. And whoso obeys ALLAH and HIS Messenger, and fears 
      ALLAH, and takes HIM as a shield for protection, it is they who will be 
      successful. <BR>53. And they swear by ALLAH their strongest oaths that, if 
      thou command them, they will surely go forth. Say, `Swear not; what is 
      required of you is obedience to what is right. Surely ALLAH is aware of 
      what you do.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
