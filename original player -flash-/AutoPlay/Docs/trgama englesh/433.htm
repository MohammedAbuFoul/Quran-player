    <TD>40. And remember the day, when HE will gather them all together; then 
      HE will say to the angels, `Was it you that they worshiped ?' <BR>41. They 
      will say, `Holy art Thou. Thou art our Protector against them. Nay, but 
      they worshiped the jinn; it was in them that most of them believed.' 
      <BR>42. It will be said to disbelievers, `So, this day, you will have no 
      power either to profit or harm one another. And WE shall say to those who 
      did wrong: `Taste ye the punishment of the Fire that you denied.' <BR>43. 
      And when Our manifest Signs are recited to them, they say, `This is but a 
      man who seeks to turn you away from that which your fathers worshiped.' 
      And they say, `This Qur'an is but a forged lie.' And those who disbelieve 
      say about the truth when it comes to them, `This is nothing but manifest 
      sorcery.' <BR>44. And WE gave them no Books which they studied, nor did WE 
      send to them any Warner before thee. <BR>45. And those who were before 
      them also rejected the truth and these have not attained even to a tenth 
      of the power which WE gave them, but they rejected MY Messengers. So they 
      shall see how terrible are the consequences of denying ME. <BR>46. Say, `I 
      only exhort you to do only one thing: that you stand up before ALLAH in 
      twos and singly and reflect. You will then realize that there is no 
      insanity in your companion; he is only a Warner to you of an impending 
      severe punishment.' <BR>47. Say, `Whatever reward I might have asked of 
      you - let it be yours. My reward is only with ALLAH; and HE is Witness 
      over all thing.' <BR>48. Say, `Truly, My Lord hurls the Truth at falsehood 
      and breaks it into pieces. HE is the Great knower of the 
  unseen.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
