    <TD>12. And you shall half of that which your wives leave, if they have no 
      child; but if they have a child, then you shall have a fourth of that 
      which they leave, after the payment of any bequests they may have 
      bequeathed or of debts. And they shall have a fourth of that which you 
      leave, if you have no child; but if you have a child, then they shall have 
      an eighth of that which you leave, after the payment of any bequests you 
      may have bequeathed or of debt. And if there be a man or a woman whose 
      heritage is to be divided and he or she has neither parent nor child, and 
      he or she has a brother and a sister, then each one of them shall have a 
      sixth. But if they be more than that, then they shall be equal sharers in 
      one-third, after the payment of any bequests which may have been 
      bequeathed or of debt. And all this shall be without intent to cause 
      injury to anyone. This is an injunction from ALLAH and ALLAH is Wise, 
      Forbearing. <BR>13. These are the limits set by ALLAH; and whoso obeys 
      ALLAH and HIS Messenger, HE will make him enter Gardens through which 
      streams flow; Therein shall they abide; and that is a great triumph. 
      <BR>14. And whoso disobeys ALLAH and HIS Messenger and transgresses HIS 
      limits. HE will make him enter into the Fire; therein he shall abide; and 
      he shall have an humiliating punishment.
