      one another ?' <BR>26. Nay, on that day they will surrender themselves 
      completely. <BR>27. And some of them will address others, questioning one 
      another. <BR>28. They will say, `Verily you used to come to us from the 
      right.' <BR>29. The others will answer, `Nay, you yourselves were not 
      believers, <BR>30. `And we had no power over you; but you yourselves were 
      a transgressing people; <BR>31. `Now the word of our Lord has been

      thrones, facing one another; <BR>45. They will be served round with a cup 
      from a flowing fountain, <BR>46. Sparkling white, delicious to the 
      drinkers; <BR>47. Wherein there will be no intoxication, nor will they be
