    <TD>48. They sought to stir up sedition even before this, and they devised 
      plots against thee till the truth came and the purpose of ALLAH prevailed, 
      though they did not like it. <BR>49. And among them is he who says, 
      `Permit me to stay behind and put me not to trial.' Surely, they have 
      already fallen into trial. And surely, Hell shall encompass the 
      disbelievers. <BR>50. If good befalls thee, it grieves them, but if a 
      misfortune befalls thee, they say, `We had indeed taken our precaution 
      beforehand.' And they turn away rejoicing. <BR>51. Say, `Nothing shall 
      befall us save that which ALLAH has ordained for us. HE is our Protector. 
      And in ALLAH then should the believers put their trust.' <BR>52. Say, `You 
      do not await for us aught save one of the two good things, while we wait 
      that ALLAH will afflict you with a punishment either from Himself or at 
      our hands. Wait then, we also are waiting.' <BR>53. Say, `Spend willingly 
      or unwillingly, it shall not be accepted from you. You are indeed a 
      disobedient people. <BR>54. And nothing prevents that their contributions 
      should be accepted from them save that they disbelieve in ALLAH and HIS 
      Messenger. And they come not to Prayer except lazily and they spend not in 
      the way of ALLAH but 
reluctantly.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
