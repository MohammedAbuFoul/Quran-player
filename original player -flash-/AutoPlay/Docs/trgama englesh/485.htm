    <TD>16. And those who dispute concerning ALLAH after HIS call has been 
      responded to - their contention is null and void in the sight of their 
      Lord; and on them will fall God's wrath and for them will be a severe 
      punishment. <BR>17. ALLAH is HE Who has sent down the Book with truth and 
      also the Balance. And what will make thee know that the Hour may be nigh ? 
      <BR>18. Those who believe not therein seek to hasten it; but those who 
      believe are fearful of it, and know that it is bound to come. Beware ! 
      those who dispute concerning the Hour are in error, far gone. <BR>19. 
      ALLAH is Benignant to HIS servants. HE provides for whom HE pleases. And 
      HE is the Powerful, the Mighty. <BR>20. Whoso desires the harvest of the 
      Hereafter, WE give him increase in his harvest; and whoso desires the 
      harvest of this world, WE give him his portion thereof, but in the 
      hereafter he will have no share. <BR>21. Have they such associates of 
      ALLAH as have made lawful for them in religion that which ALLAH has not 
      allowed ? And but for Our word about the final judgment, the matter would 
      have been decided by now between them. And, surely, the wrongdoers will 
      have a grievous punishment. <BR>22. Thou wilt see the wrongdoers in fear 
      on account of that which they have earned, and it is sure to befall them. 
      But those who believe and do good works will be in meadows of the Gardens. 
      They shall have with their Lord whatever they will desire. That is the 
      great bounty of ALLAH.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
