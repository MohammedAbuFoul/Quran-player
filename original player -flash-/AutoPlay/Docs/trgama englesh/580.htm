    <TD>26. And during the night prostrate thyself before HIM, and extol HIS 
      glory for a long part of the night. <BR>27. Verily, these people love the 
      present life, and they neglect a very hard day ahead. <BR>28. WE have 
      created them and have strengthened their make; and when WE will, WE can 
      replace them by others like them. <BR>29. Verily, this is a Reminder. So 
      whoever wishes, may take a way unto his Lord. <BR>30. But you cannot so 
      wish unless ALLAH so wills. Verily, ALLAH is All-Knowing, Wise. <BR>31. HE 
      admits into HIS mercy whom HE pleases and for the wrongdoers HE has 
      prepared a painful punishment. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. By those who send forth to spread goodness, <BR>2. Then they push on 
      with a forceful pushing, <BR>3. And by those who spread the Truth, a good 
      spreading, <BR>4. Then they distinguish fully between good and evil; 
      <BR>5. Then they carry the Exhortation far and wide, <BR>6. To excuse some 
      and warn others, <BR>7. Verily, that which you are promised must come to 
      pass. <BR>8. So when the stars are made to lose their light, <BR>9. And 
      when the heaven is rent asunder, <BR>10. And when the mountains are blown 
      away like dust, <BR>11. And when the Messengers are made to appear at the 
      appointed time - <BR>12. To what day have these portents been deferred ? 
      <BR>13. To the Day of Decision. <BR>14. And what should make thee know 
      what the Day of Decision is - <BR>15. Woe on that day unto those who 
      reject the Truth ! <BR>16. Did WE not destroy the earlier peoples ? 
      <BR>17. WE will now cause the later ones to follow them. <BR>18. Thus do 
      WE deal with the guilty. <BR>19. Woe on that day unto those who reject the 
      Truth !&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
