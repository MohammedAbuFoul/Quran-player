    <TD>225. ALLAH will not call you to account for such of your oaths as are 
      vain, but HE will call you to account for what your hearts have earned. 
      And ALLAH is Most forgiving, Forbearing. <BR>226. For those who vow 
      abstinence from their wives, the maximum period of waiting is four months. 
      Then if they go back to their normal relationship, surely ALLAH is Most 
      forgiving, Merciful.<BR>227. And if they decide upon divorce, then surely 
      ALLAH is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. <BR>228. And the divorced women shall 
      wait concerning themselves for three courses; and it is not lawful for 
      them that they conceal what ALLAH has created in their wombs, if they 
      believe in ALLAH and the Last Day; and their husbands have the greater 
      right to take them back during that period, provided they desire 
      reconciliation. And they (the women) have rights similar to those (of men) 
      over them in equity; but men have a degree of advantage above them. And 
      ALLAH is Mighty and Wise.<BR>229. Such divorce may be pronounced twice; 
      then either retain them in a becoming manner or send them away with 
      kindness. And it is not lawful for you that you take anything of what you 
      have given them (your wives) unless both fear that they cannot observe the 
      limits prescribe by ALLAH. But if you fear that they cannot observe the 
      limits prescribed by ALLAH, then it shall be no sin for either of them in 
      what she gives to get her freedom. These are the limits prescribed by 
      ALLAH, so transgress them not; and whoso transgresses the limits 
      prescribed by ALLAH, it is they that are the wrongdoers. <BR>230. And if 
      he divorces her the third time, then she is not lawful for him thereafter, 
      until she marries another husband; and, if he also divorces her, then it 
      shall be no sin for them to return to each other, provided they are sure 
      that they would be able to observe the limits prescribed by ALLAH. And 
      these are the limits prescribed by ALLAH which HE makes clear to the 
      people who have knowledge.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
