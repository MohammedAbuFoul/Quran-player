    <TD>1. What do they question one another about ? <BR>2. About the mighty 
      Event, <BR>3. Concerning which they differ. <BR>4. Nay, soon they will 
      come to know. <BR>5. Nay, WE say it again, they will soon come to know. 
      <BR>6. Have WE not made the earth as a bed, <BR>7. And the mountains as 
      pegs ? <BR>8. And WE have created you in pairs, <BR>9. And have made your 
      sleep for rest, <BR>10. And have made the night as a covering, <BR>11. And 
      have made the day for the pursuits of life. <BR>12. And WE have built 
      above you seven strong ones; <BR>13. And have made the sun a bright lamp. 
      <BR>14. And WE send down from the dripping clouds water pouring forth 
      abundantly. <BR>15. That WE may bring forth thereby grain and vegetation, 
      <BR>16. And gardens of luxuriant growth. <BR>17. Surely, the Day of 
      Decision is an appointed time <BR>18. The day when the trumpet will be 
      blown, and you will come in large groups. <BR>19. And the heaven shall be 
      opened and shall become all doors. <BR>20. And the mountains shall be set 
      in motion and shall become, as if they were, a mirage. <BR>21. Surely, 
      Hell lies in ambush, <BR>22. A resort for the rebellious, <BR>23. Who will 
      tarry therein for ages. <BR>24. They will taste therein neither coolness, 
      nor drink, <BR>25. Save boiling water and a stinking fluid, intensely cold 
      - <BR>26. A meet requital. <BR>27. Verily, they feared not the reckoning, 
      <BR>28. And rejected Our Signs totally. <BR>29. And everything have WE 
      recorded in a Book. <BR>30. `Taste ye, therefore, the punishment; WE will 
      give you no increase except in 
torment.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
