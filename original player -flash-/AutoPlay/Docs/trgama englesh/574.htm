    <TD>1. O thou wrapped up in thy mantle, <BR>2. Stand up in Prayer at night 
      except a small portion thereof <BR>3. Half of it, or reduce from it a 
      little, <BR>4. Or, add to it a little - and recite the Qur'an a good 
      recital. <BR>5. Verily, WE are about to charge thee with a weighty Word. 
      <BR>6. Verily, getting up at night for Prayer is the most potent means of 
      subduing the self and most effective in speech. <BR>7. Thou hast, indeed, 
      during the day a long chain of engagements. <BR>8. So remember the name of 
      thy Lord and devote thyself to HIM with full devotion. <BR>9. HE is the 
      Lord of the East and the West; there is no god but HE; so take him for thy 
      Guardian. <BR>10. And bear patiently all that they say; and withdraw from 
      them in a decent manner. <BR>11. And leave ME alone with those who reject 
      the truth, possessors of ease and plenty; and give them a little respite. 
      <BR>12. Surely, with US are heavy fetters and a raging fire, <BR>13. And 
      food that chokes, and a painful punishment - <BR>14. On the day when the 
      earth and the mountains shall quake, and the mountains will become like 
      crumbling sand-hills. <BR>15. Verily, WE have sent to you a Messenger, who 
      is a witness over you, even as WE sent a Messenger to Pharaoh; <BR>16. But 
      Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger, so WE seized him with a terrible seizing. 
      <BR>17. How will you then, if you disbelieve, guard yourselves against a 
      day which will turn children grey-headed ? <BR>18. The day when the heaven 
      will be rent asunder; and HIS promise is bound to be fulfilled. <BR>19. 
      This, surely, is a reminder. So let him, who will, take a way unto his 
      Lord.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
