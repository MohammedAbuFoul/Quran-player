    <TD>6. Surely, there is a good example in them for you - for all who have 
      hope to see ALLAH and the Last Day. And whosoever turns away - truly, 
      ALLAH is Self-Sufficient, Worthy of all praise. <BR>7. It may be that 
      ALLAH will bring about love between you and those of them with whom you 
      are now at enmity, and ALLAH is All-Powerful; and ALLAH is Most Forgiving, 
      Merciful. <BR>8. ALLAH forbids you not respecting those who have not 
      fought against you on account of your religion, and who have not driven 
      you out from your homes, that you be kind to them and deal equitably with 
      them; surely, ALLAH loves those who are equitable. <BR>9. ALLAH only 
      forbids you respecting those who have fought against you on account of 
      your religion and have driven you out of your homes, and have helped 
      others in driving you out, that you make friends with them, and whosoever 
      makes friends with them - it is these that are transgressors. <BR>10. O ye 
      who believe ! when believing women come to you as Refugees, examine them. 
      ALLAH knows best their faith. Then if you find them true believers, send 
      them not back to the disbelievers. These women are not lawful for them, 
      nor are they lawful for these women. But give their disbelieving husbands 
      what they have spent on them. Thereafter it is no sin for you to marry 
      them, when you have given them their dowries. And hold not to your 
      matrimonial ties of the disbelieving women, but should they join the 
      disbelievers, then demand the return of that which you have spent; and let 
      the disbelieving husbands of believing women demand that which they have 
      spent. That is the judgment of ALLAH. HE judges between you. And ALLAH is 
      All-Knowing, Wise. <BR>11. And if any of your wives goes away from you to 
      the disbelievers, and afterwards you retaliate and get some spoils from 
      the disbelievers, then give to those believers whose wives have gone away 
      the like of that which they have spent on them. And fear ALLAH in Whom you 
      believe.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
