    <TD>65. And ALLAH has sent down water from the sky and has quickened the 
      earth after its death. Surely, in that is a Sign for a people who would 
      listen to the truth. <BR>66. And surely in the cattle too there is a 
      lesson for you. WE provide for you drink out of that which is in their 
      bellies -from betwixt the faeces and the blood - milk pure and pleasant 
      for those who drink it. <BR>67. And of the fruits of the date-palms and 
      the grapes, whence you obtain intoxicating drink and wholesome food. 
      Verily in that is a Sign for a people who use their understanding. <BR>68. 
      And thy Lord revealed to the bee : `Make thou houses in the hills and in 
      the trees and in the trellises which they build, <BR>69. `Then eat all 
      manner of fruits, and follow the ways taught to thee by thy Lord and which 
      have been made easy for thee.' There comes from their bellies a drink of 
      varying hues. Therein is a healing for mankind. Surely, in that is Sign 
      for a people who reflect. <BR>70. And ALLAH creates you, then HE causes 
      you to die; and there are some among you who are driven to the worst state 
      of life with the result that they know nothing after having had knowledge. 
      Surely, ALLAH is All-Knowing, Powerful. <BR>71. And ALLAH has favoured 
      some of you above others in worldly gifts. But those more favoured will 
      not restore any part of their worldly gifts to those whom their right 
      hands possess, so that they may be equal shares in them. Knowing this, 
      will they still deny the favour of ALLAH ? <BR>72. And ALLAH has made for 
      you mates from among yourselves, and has made for you, from your mates, 
      sons and grandsons, and has provided you with good things. Will they then 
      believe in that which perishes and deny the favour of ALLAH 
  ?&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
