    <TD>1. Ha Mim. <BR>2. By this perspicuous Book. <BR>3. Truly, WE revealed 
      it in a blessed night. Truly, WE have ever been warning. <BR>4. Therein 
      are decided all matters of wisdom <BR>5. By our own command. Verily, WE 
      have ever been sending Messengers, <BR>6. As a mercy from thy Lord. 
      Verily, HE is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, <BR>7. The Lord of the 
      heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if you would only be 
      inclined to believe. <BR>8. There is no god but HE. HE gives life and HE 
      causes death. HE is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers. <BR>9. Yet 
      they play about in doubt. <BR>10. So watch thou for the day when the sky 
      will bring forth a visible smoke, <BR>11. That will envelope the people. 
      This will be a painful torment. <BR>12. On seeing it the people will cry, 
      `Our Lord, remove from us the torment; truly, we are believers.' <BR>13. 
      How can they benefit by admonition, when there has already come to them a 
      Messenger explaining things clearly, <BR>14. And yet they turned away from 
      him and said, `He is tutored, a man possessed !' <BR>15. WE shall remove 
      the punishment for a little while, but you will certainly revert to 
      mischief. <BR>16. On the day when WE shall seize you with the great 
      seizure, you will know that WE will, certainly, exact retribution. <BR>17. 
      And WE tried the people of Pharaoh before them, and there came to them a 
      noble Messenger, <BR>18. Who said to them, `Deliver to me the servants of 
      ALLAH. Truly, I am to you a Messenger, faithful to my 
  trust;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
