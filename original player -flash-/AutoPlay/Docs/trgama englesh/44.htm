    <TD>260. And remember when Abraham said, `My Lord, show me how THOU givest 
      life to the dead.' God said, `Dost thou not believe ?' Abraham said, `Yes, 
      but I ask this that my heart may be at ease.' God answered, `Take four 
      birds and make them attached to thee. Then put each of them on a hill; 
      then call them; they will come to thee in haste.' And know that ALLAH is 
      Mighty and Wise.<BR>261. The similitude of those who spend their wealth in 
      the way of ALLAH is like the similitude of a grain of corn which grows 
      seven ears, in each ear a hundred grains. And ALLAH multiplies it further 
      for whomsoever HE pleases and ALLAH is Bountiful, All-Knowing. <BR>262. 
      They who spend their wealth in the way of ALLAH, then follow not up what 
      they have spent with taunt or injury, for them is their reward with their 
      Lord, and they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve. <BR>263. A kind 
      word and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury. And ALLAH 
      is Self-Sufficient, Forbearing.<BR>264. O ye who believe ! render not vain 
      your alms by reproach and injury like him who spends his wealth to be seen 
      by men, and he believes not in ALLAH and the Last Day. His case is like 
      the case of a smooth rock covered with earth, on which heavy rain falls, 
      leaving it bare and hard, They shall not secure aught of what they earn. 
      And ALLAH guides not the disbelieving 
people.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
