    <TD>17. Bear patiently what they say, and remember Our servant David, the 
      man of might; surely he was always turning to God. <BR>18. WE subjected to 
      him the mountains - they celebrated God's praises with him at nightfall 
      and sunrise. <BR>19. And WE subjected to him the birds gathered together; 
      all constantly turned to him. <BR>20. And WE strengthened his kingdom, and 
      gave him wisdom and decisive judgment. <BR>21. And has the story of the 
      disputants reached thee when they climbed over the wall of his private 
      chamber ? - <BR>22. When they entered in upon David, and he was afraid of 
      them. They said, `Fear not. We are two disputants; one of us has 
      transgressed against the other; so judge between us with justice, and 
      deviate not from the right course and guide us to the right way.' <BR>23. 
      `Now this my brother has ninety-nine ewes, and I have only one ewe. Yet he 
      says, `Give it to me,' and he has been overbearing to me in his address.' 
      <BR>24. David said, `Surely, he has wronged thee in asking for thy ewe to 
      add to his own ewes. And certainly many partners transgress against one 
      another, except those who believe in ALLAH and act righteously; and these 
      are but few.' And David thought that WE had tried him; so he asked 
      forgiveness of his Lord, and fell down bowing in worship and turned to 
      HIM. <BR>25. So WE forgave him his default; and, indeed, he had a position 
      of nearness with US and an excellent resort. <BR>26. Then WE said to him, 
      `O David, WE have made thee a viceregent in the earth; so judge between 
      men with justice, and follow not vain desire, lest it should lead thee 
      astray from the way of ALLAH.' Surely, those, who go astray from the way 
      of ALLAH, will have a severe punishment, because they forgot the Day of 
      Reckoning.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
