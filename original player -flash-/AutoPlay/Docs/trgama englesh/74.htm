    <TD>181. And surely, ALLAH has heard the utterance of those who said, 
      `ALLAH is poor and we are rich.' WE shall record what they have said, and 
      their attempts to slay the Prophets unjustly; and WE shall say, `Take ye 
      the punishment of the burning;' <BR>182. That is because of that which 
      your hands have sent on before.' and ALLAH is not at all unjust to HIS 
      servants. <BR>183. Those who say, `ALLAH has charged us not to believe in 
      any Messenger until he brings us an offering which fire devours.' Say, 
      `There have already come to you Messengers before me with clear Signs and 
      with that which you ask for. Why, then, did you seek to slay them, if you 
      are truthful ?' <BR>184. And if they accuse thee of lying, even so were 
      accused of lying Messengers before thee who came with clear Signs and 
      Books of wisdom and the illuminating Book. <BR>185. Every soul shall taste 
      of death. And you shall be paid in full your rewards only on the Day of 
      Resurrection. So whosoever is removed away from the Fire and is made to 
      enter Heaven has indeed attained his goal. And the life of this world is 
      nothing but an illusory enjoyment. <BR>186. You shall surely be tried in 
      your possessions and your persons and you shall surely hear many hurtful 
      things from those who were given the Book before you and from those who 
      set up equals to ALLAH. But if you show patience and fortitude and act 
      righteously, that indeed is a matter of high 
resolve.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
