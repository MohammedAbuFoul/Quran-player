    <TD>60. Hast thou not seen those who assert that they believe in what has 
      been revealed to thee and what has been revealed before thee ? They desire 
      to seek judgment from the Evil One, although they were commanded not to 
      obey him. And Satan desires to lead them far astray. <BR>61. And when it 
      is said to them, `Come ye to what ALLAH has sent down and to His 
      Messenger,' thou seest the hypocrites turn away from thee with aversion. 
      <BR>62. Then how is it that when an affliction befalls them because of 
      what their hands have sent on before, they come to thee swearing by ALLAH, 
      saying, `We meant nothing but the doing of good and conciliation.' <BR>63. 
      These are they, the secrets of whose hearts ALLAH knows well. So turn away 
      from them and admonish them and speak to them an effective word concerning 
      themselves. <BR>64. And WE have sent no Messenger but that he should be 
      obeyed by the command of ALLAH. And if they had come to thee, when they 
      had wronged their souls, and asked forgiveness of ALLAH, and the Messenger 
      also had asked forgiveness for them, they would have surely found ALLAH 
      Oft-Returning with compassion, and Merciful. <BR>65. But no, by thy Lord, 
      they will not be true believers until they make thee judge in all that is 
      in dispute between them and then find not in their hearts any demur 
      concerning that which thou decidest and submit with full 
    submission.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
