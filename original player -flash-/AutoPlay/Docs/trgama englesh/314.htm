    <TD>38. `When WE revealed to thy mother what was an important revelation, 
      to wit: <BR>39. `Put him in the ark, and place in into the river, then the 
      river will cast it on to the shore, and there one who is an enemy to ME 
      and also an enemy to him will take him up.' And I wrapped thee with love 
      from ME; and this I did that thou mightest be reared before MY eye; 
      <BR>40. `When thy sister walked along and said, `Shall I direct you to one 
      who will take charge of him ? So WE restored thee to thy mother that her 
      eye might be cooled and she might not grieve. And thou didst slay a man, 
      but WE delivered thee from sorrow. Then WE tried thee with various trials. 
      And thou didst tarry several years among the people of Midian. Then thou 
      camest up to the required standard, O Moses; <BR>41. `And I have chosen 
      thee for Myself; <BR>42. `Go, thou and thy brother, with MY Signs, and 
      slacken not in remembering ME; <BR>43. `Go, both of you, to Pharaoh, for 
      he has transgressed all bounds; <BR>44. `But speak to him a gentle word, 
      haply he might take heed or fear.' <BR>45. They replied, `Our Lord, we 
      fear lest he commit some excess against us, or exceed all bounds in 
      persecuting us.' <BR>46. God said, `Fear not; for I am with you both. I 
      hear and I see. <BR>47. `So go ye both to him and say, `We are the 
      Messengers of thy Lord; so let the Children of Israel go with us; and 
      torment them not. We have, indeed, brought thee a great Sign from thy 
      Lord; and peace shall be on him who follows the guidance; <BR>48. It has, 
      indeed, been revealed to us that punishment shall come upon him who 
      rejects the Message of God and turns away.' <BR>49. Pharaoh said, `Who 
      then is the Lord of you two, O Moses ?' <BR>50. Moses said, `Our Lord is 
      HE Who gave unto everything its proper form and then guided it to its 
      proper function.' <BR>51. Pharaoh said, `What will be the fate of the 
      former generations ?'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
