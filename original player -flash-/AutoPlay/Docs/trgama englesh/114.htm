    <TD>37. They would wish to come out of the Fire, but they will not be able 
      to come out of it and they shall have a lasting punishment. <BR>38. And as 
      for the man who steals and the woman who steals, cut of their hands in 
      retribution of their offence as an exemplary punishment from ALLAH. And 
      ALLAH is Mighty, Wise. <BR>39. But whoso repents after his transgression 
      and amends, then will ALLAH surely turn to him in mercy; verily, ALLAH is 
      most Forgiving and Merciful. <BR>40. Dost thou not know that ALLAH is HE 
      to Whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth ? HE punishes 
      whom HE pleases and forgives whom HE pleases, and ALLAH has power over all 
      things. <BR>41. O Messenger ! let not those grieve thee who hasten to fall 
      into disbelief - those who say with their mouths, `We believe,' but their 
      hearts believe not. And among the Jews too are those who would fondly 
      listen to any lie - who listen for conveying it to other people who have 
      not come to thee. They pervert words after their being put in their right 
      places; and say, `If you are given this, then accept it, but if you are 
      not given this, then keep away from it.' And as for him whom ALLAH desires 
      to try, thou shalt not avail him aught against ALLAH. These are they whose 
      hearts ALLAH has not been pleased to purify; they shall have disgrace in 
      this world, and in the Hereafter they shall have a severe 
    punishment.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
