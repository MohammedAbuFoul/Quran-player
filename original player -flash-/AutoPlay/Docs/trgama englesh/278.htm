    <TD>94. And make not your oaths a means of deceit between you; or you foot 
      will slip after it has been firmly established and you will taste evil 
      because by acting thus you have turned people away from the path of ALLAH, 
      and you will have a severe punishment. <BR>95. And barter not the covenant 
      of ALLAH for a paltry price. Surely, that which is with ALLAH is better 
      for you if you knew. <BR>96. That which you have shall pass away, but that 
      which is with ALLAH is lasting. And WE will certainly give those, who are 
      steadfast, their reward according to the best of their works. <BR>97. 
      Whoso acts righteously, whether male or female and is a believer, WE will 
      surely grant him a pure life; and WE will surely bestow on such their 
      reward according to the best of their works. <BR>98. And when thou 
      recitest the Qur'an, seek refuge with ALLAH from Satan, the rejected. 
      <BR>99. Surely he has no power over those who believe and who put their 
      trust in their Lord. <BR>100. His power is only over those who make 
      friends with him and those who associate partners with him. <BR>101. And 
      when WE bring one Sign in place of another - and ALLAH knows best the 
      object of what HE reveals - they say, `Thou art but a fabricator,' Nay, 
      but most of them know not. <BR>102. Say, `The Spirit of holiness has 
      brought it down from thy Lord with truth, that HE may strengthen in their 
      faith those who believe and as a guidance and glad tidings for 
    Muslims.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
