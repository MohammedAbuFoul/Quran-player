    <TD>34. Say, `Is there any of your associated-gods who originates creation 
      and then reproduces it ?' Say, `It is ALLAH alone Who originates creation 
      and then reproduces it. Wither then are you turned away ?' <BR>35. Say, 
      `Is there any of your associated-gods who guides to the truth ?' Say, `It 
      is ALLAH alone Who guides to the truth. Is then HE Who guides to the truth 
      more worthy to be followed, or he who finds not the way himself unless he 
      be guided ? What, then, is the matter with you ? How judge ye ?' <BR>36. 
      And most of them follow only conjecture. Surely, conjecture avails naught 
      against the truth. Verily, ALLAH is well aware of what they do. <BR>37. 
      And this Qur'an is not such that could be produced by anyone other than 
      ALLAH. On the contrary, it fulfills that revelation which is before it and 
      is an exposition of the perfect Law. There is no doubt about it that it is 
      from the Lord of all the worlds. <BR>38. Do they say, `He has forged it ?' 
      Say, `Bring then a Surah like unto it, and call for help on all you can, 
      apart from ALLAH, if you are truthful.' <BR>39. Nay, but they have 
      rejected that, full knowledge of which they did not compass nor has the 
      true significance thereof yet come to them. In like manner did those 
      before them reject the truth. But see what was the end of the wrongdoers. 
      <BR>40. And of them there are some who believe therein, and of them are 
      others who do not believe therein, and thy Lord knows the mischief-makers 
      very well. <BR>41. And if they charge thee with lying, say, `For me is my 
      work and for you is your work. You are not accountable for what I do and I 
      am not accountable for what you do.' <BR>42. And among them are some who 
      give ear to thee. But canst thou make the deaf hear, even though they 
      understand not ?&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
