    <TD>107. And among the Hypocrites are those who have built a mosque in 
      order to injure Islam and help disbelief and to cause a division among the 
      believers, and to prepare an ambush for him who warred against ALLAH and 
      HIS Messenger before this. And they will surely swear; `We meant nothing 
      but good;' But ALLAH bears witness that they are certainly liars. <BR>108. 
      Never stand to pray therein. A Mosque founded upon piety from the very 
      first day is surely more worthy that thou shouldst stand to pray therein. 
      In it are men who love to become purified, And ALLAH loves those who 
      purify themselves. <BR>109. Is he, then, who founded his building on the 
      fear of ALLAH and HIS pleasure better or he who has founded his building 
      on the brink of a tottering water-worn bank which tumbled down with him 
      into the fire of Hell ? And ALLAH guides not the wrongdoing people. 
      <BR>110. This building of theirs, which they have built, will ever 
      continue to be a source of disquiet in their hearts, unless their hearts 
      be cut into pieces. And ALLAH is All-Knowing, Wise. <BR>111. Surely, ALLAH 
      has purchased of the believers their persons and their property in return 
      for the heavenly Garden they shall have; they fight in the cause of ALLAH, 
      and they slay and are slain - an unfailing promise that HE has made 
      binding on Himself in the Torah, and the Gospel, and the Qur'an. And who 
      is more faithful to his promise than ALLAH ? Rejoice, then, in your 
      bargain which you have made with HIM; and that is the mighty 
    triumph.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
