    <TD>118. And if thy Lord had enforced HIS will, HE would have surely made 
      mankind one people; but they would not cease to differ; <BR>119. Save 
      those on whom thy Lord has had mercy, and for this has HE created them. 
      But the word of thy Lord shall be fulfilled: `Verily, I will fill Hell 
      with the disobedient jinn and men all together.' <BR>120. And WE relate 
      unto thee all the important tidings of the Messengers, whereby WE 
      strengthen thy heart. And herein has come to thee the truth and an 
      exhortation and a reminder for the believers. <BR>121. And say to those 
      who believe not, `Act as you can, we too are acting;' <BR>122. `And wait 
      ye, we too are waiting.' <BR>123. And to ALLAH belongs the unseen in the 
      heavens and the earth, and to HIM shall the whole affair be referred. So 
      worship HIM and put thy trust in HIM alone. And thy Lord is not unmindful 
      of what you do. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. Alif Lam Ra. These are verses of the clear Book. <BR>2. WE have 
      revealed it - the Qur'an in Arabic - that you may understand. <BR>3. WE 
      relate unto thee the best of narrative in that WE have revealed to thee 
      this Qur'an though thou wast, before this among those unaware of the 
      truth. <BR>4. Remember the time when Joseph said to his father, O my 
      father, I saw in a dream eleven stars and the sun and the moon - I saw 
      them making obeisance to 
me.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
