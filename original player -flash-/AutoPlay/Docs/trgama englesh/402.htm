    <TD>46. And argue not with the people of the Book except with what is best 
      as an argument, but argue not at all with such of them as are unjust. And 
      say, `We believe in that which has been revealed to us and that which has 
      been revealed to you; and our God and your God is One, and to HIM we 
      submit.' <BR>47. And in like manner have WE sent down the Book to thee; so 
      those to whom WE have given true knowledge of the Book (Torah) believe in 
      it (the Qur'an); and of these Meccans also there are some who believe in 
      it. And none but the disbelievers persist in rejecting Our Signs. <BR>48. 
      And thou didst not recite any Book before the Qur'an, nor didst thou write 
      one with thy right hand; in that case the liars would have had cause to 
      doubt. <BR>49. Nay, it is a collection of clear Signs in the hearts of 
      those who are given knowledge. And none but the wrongdoers deny Our Signs. 
      <BR>50. And they say, `Why are not Signs sent down to him from his Lord ?' 
      Say, `The Signs are with ALLAH, and I am but a plain warner,' <BR>51. Is 
      it not enough for a Sign for them that WE have sent down to thee the 
      perfect Book which is recited to them ? Verily, in this there is great 
      mercy and a reminder for a people who believe. <BR>52. Say, `ALLAH is 
      sufficient as a Witness between me and you. HE knows what is in the 
      heavens and the earth. And as for those who believe in falsehood and 
      disbelieve in ALLAH, they it is who are the 
losers.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
