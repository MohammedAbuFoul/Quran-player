    <TD>7. While their eyes will be cast down and they will come forth from 
      their graves as though they were locust scattered about, <BR>8. Hastening 
      towards the Summoner. The disbelievers will say, `This is a hard day.' 
      <BR>9. The people of Noah rejected the truth before them; they called Our 
      servant a liar and said, `He is a madman, afflicted by our idols.' <BR>10. 
      So he prayed to his Lord: `I am overcome, so come thou to my help !' 
      <BR>11. Thereupon WE opened the gates of heaven with water which fell in 
      torrents; <BR>12. And WE caused the earth to burst forth with springs, so 
      the two waters met for a purpose that was decreed. <BR>13. And WE carried 
      him upon that which was made of planks and nails. <BR>14. It floated on 
      under Our eyes; a reward for him who had been denied. <BR>15. And WE left 
      it as a Sign for the succeeding generations. But is there anyone who would 
      take heed ? <BR>16. How terrible, then, was MY punishment and how true MY 
      warning ! <BR>17. And indeed, WE have made the Qur'an easy to remember. Is 
      there anyone who would take heed ? <BR>18. The tribe of Ad rejected the 
      truth. How terrible, then, was MY punishment and how true MY warning ! 
      <BR>19. WE sent against them a furious wind on a day of unending ill-luck, 
      <BR>20. Tearing people away as though they were the hollow trunks of 
      uprooted palm-trees. <BR>21. How terrible, then, was MY punishment and how 
      true MY warning ! <BR>22. And indeed, WE have made the Qur'an easy to 
      remember. But is there anyone who would take heed ? <BR>23. The tribe of 
      Thamud also rejected the Warners. <BR>24. And they said, `What ! shall we 
      follow a mortal, one out of ourselves ? Then, indeed, we would be in 
      manifest error, and suffering from madness. <BR>25. `Has the Reminder been 
      revealed to him alone of all of us ? Nay, he is an impudent liar.' <BR>26. 
      Tomorrow will they know who is the impudent liar. <BR>27. We will send the 
      she-camel as a trial for them. So watch them, O Salih, and have 
    patience.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
