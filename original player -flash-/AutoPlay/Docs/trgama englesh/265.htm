    <TD>52. When they came to him and said, `Peace be upon you,' He answered, 
      `Verily, we are afraid of you.' <BR>53. They said, `Be not afraid; we give 
      thee glad tidings of a son who shall be endowed with great knowledge.' 
      <BR>54. He said, `Do you give me this glad tidings despite the fact that 
      old age has overtaken me ? On what basis, then, do you give me this glad 
      tidings ?' <BR>55. They said, `We have indeed given thee true glad 
      tidings, be not, therefore, of those who despair.' <BR>56. He said, `And 
      who despairs of the mercy of his Lord but such as go astray ?' <BR>57. He 
      said, `What now is your real business, O ye messengers ?' <BR>58. They 
      said, `We have been sent unto a guilty people, <BR>59. Except the 
      followers of Lot, Them shall we save all, <BR>60. `Except his wife. We 
      have decreed that she shall be of those who remain behind.' <BR>61. And 
      when the messengers came unto lot and his followers; <BR>62. He said, 
      `Verily, you a party of strangers.' <BR>63. They said, `Yea; but we have 
      brought thee that news of the punishment concerning which they have been 
      in doubt; <BR>64. `And we have brought thee sure news, and certainly we 
      are truthful; <BR>65. `So go forth with thy family in the latter part of 
      the night, and follow thou in their rear. And let none of you look back, 
      and now proceed to where you are commanded.' <BR>66. And WE communicated 
      to him clearly this decree that the roots of these people would be cut off 
      by the morning. <BR>67. And the people of the city came rejoicing. <BR>68. 
      He said, `These are my guests, so put me not to shame. <BR>69. `And fear 
      ALLAH and do not humiliate me.' <BR>70. They said, `Did we not forbid thee 
      to entertain any people ?'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
