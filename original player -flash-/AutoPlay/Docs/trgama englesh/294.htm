    <TD>5. No knowledge have they thereof, nor had their fathers. Monstrous is 
      the word that comes out of their mouths. They speak naught but a lie. 
      <BR>6. So it may be, thou wilt grieve thyself to death sorrowing after 
      them if they believe not in this Discourse. <BR>7. Verily, WE have made 
      all that is on the earth an ornament for it, that WE may try them as to 
      which of them is the best in conduct. <BR>8. And WE shall destroy all that 
      is thereon and make it a barren soil. <BR>9. Dost thou think that the 
      Companions of the Cave and the Inscription were a wonder among Our Signs ? 
      <BR>10. When the young men betook themselves to the Cave for refuge they 
      said, `Our Lord, bestow on us mercy from Thyself, and furnish us with 
      right guidance in our affair.' <BR>11. So WE prevented them from hearing 
      in the Cave for a number of years. <BR>12. Then WE raised them up that WE 
      might know which of the two parties would preserve a better reckoning of 
      the time that they tarried. <BR>13. WE will relate to thee the story with 
      truth. They were young men who believed in their Lord and WE increased 
      them in guidance. <BR>14. And WE strengthened their hearts when they stood 
      up and said, `Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. Never 
      shall we call on any god beside HIM; for if we did so, we would utter a 
      preposterous thing; <BR>15. `These, our people, have taken for worship 
      other gods beside HIM. Wherefore do they not bring a clear authority 
      regarding them ? And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie 
      concerning ALLAH ?&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
