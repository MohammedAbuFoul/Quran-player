    <TD>44. They replied, `These are confused dreams and we do not know the 
      interpretation of confused dreams.' <BR>45. And he of the two who was 
      released and who now remembered after a time, said, `I will let you know 
      its interpretation, therefore, send ye me.' <BR>46. And he came to Joseph 
      and said, `Joseph ! O thou man of truth, explain to us the meaning of 
      seeing in a dream seven fat kine which seven lean ones devour, and of 
      seven green ears of corn and seven others withered; that I may return to 
      the people so that they may know the interpretation.' <BR>47. Joseph 
      replied, `You shall sow for seven years, working diligently throughout; 
      then leave, what you reap in its ear, except a little which you shall eat; 
      <BR>48. `Then shall come after that seven hard years, which shall consume 
      all that you shall have laid by in advance for them except a little which 
      you may preserve; <BR>49. `Then shall come after that a year in which 
      people shall be relieved and which they shall give presents to each other.

      King said to the women, `What was the truth of that matter of yours when 
      you sought to seduce Joseph against his will ?' They said, `He kept away 
      from sin for fear of ALLAH - we have known no evil against him.' The wife 
      of Aziz said, `Now has the truth come to light. It was I who sought to 
      seduce him against his will and surely, he is of the truthful.' <BR>52. 
      Joseph said, I ask for this inquiry to be made so that the Aziz might know 
      that I was not unfaithful to him in his absence and that ALLAH suffers not 
      the device of the unfaithful to 
succeed;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
