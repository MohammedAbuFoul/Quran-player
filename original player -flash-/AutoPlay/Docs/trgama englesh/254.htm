    <TD>35. The similitude of the Garden promised to the God-fearing is that 
      through it flow streams; its fruit is everlasting, and so is its shade. 
      That is the reward of those who are righteous; and the end of the 
      disbelievers is Fire. <BR>36. And those to whom WE have given the Book 
      rejoice in what has been revealed to thee. And of the different parties 
      there are some who deny part thereof. Say `I am only commanded to worship 
      ALLAH and not to set up equals to HIM. Unto HIM do I call and unto HIM is 
      my return. <BR>37. And thus have WE revealed it, a clear judgment in 
      Arabic. And if thou follow their evil desires after the knowledge that has 
      come to thee, thou shalt have no friend nor defender against ALLAH. 
      <BR>38. And, indeed, WE sent Messengers before thee, and WE gave them 
      wives and children. And it is not possible for a Messenger to bring a Sign 
      save by the command of ALLAH. For every term there is a divine decree. 
      <BR>39. ALLAH effaces and establishes what HE wills, and with HIM is the 
      source of all commandments. <BR>40. And whether WE show thee in thy 
      life-time the fulfillment of some of the things which WE threaten them or 
      whether WE cause the to die, it makes little difference, for on thee lies 
      only the delivery of the Message, and on US the reckoning. <BR>41. Do they 
      not see that WE are visiting the land, reducing it from its outlying 
      boarders ? And ALLAH judges; there is none to reverse HIS judgment. And HE 
      is Swift at reckoning. <BR>42. And those who were before them did also 
      devise plans but all effective devising of plans belongs to ALLAH. HE 
      knows what every soul earns; and the disbelievers shall soon know whose 
      will be the final reward of the 
Abode.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
