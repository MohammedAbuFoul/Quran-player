    <TD>1. Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth glorifies 
      ALLAH. HIS is the Kingdom and HIS is the praise, and HE has power over all 
      things. <BR>2. It is HE Who has created you, but some of you are 
      disbelievers and some of you are believers. And ALLAH sees what you do. 
      <BR>3. HE created the heavens and the earth with an eternal purpose and HE 
      gave you shape and made your shapes beautiful, and to HIM is the ultimate 
      return. <BR>4. HE knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and HE 
      knows what you hide and what you disclose; and ALLAH knows full well all 
      that which is hidden in the breasts. <BR>5. Has there not come to you the 
      account of those who disbelieved before ? They tasted the evil 
      consequences of their conduct, and for them is decreed painful punishment. 
      <BR>6. That was because their Messengers came to them with manifest Signs, 
      but they said, `Shall mere mortals guide us ?' So they disbelieved and 
      turned away, but ALLAH had no need of them; And ALLAH is Self-Sufficient, 
      Worthy of all praise. <BR>7. Those who disbelieve think that they will not 
      be raised up. Say, `Yea, by my Lord, you shall, surely, be raised up; then 
      you shall, certainly, be informed of what you did. And that is easy for 
      ALLAH.' <BR>8. Believe, therefore, in ALLAH and HIS Messenger, and in the 
      Light which WE have sent down. And ALLAH is Well-Aware of all that you do. 
      <BR>9. The day when HE shall gather you for the Day of Gathering; that 
      will be the day of the determination of losses and gains. And whoso 
      believes in ALLAH and acts righteously - HE will remove from them the evil 
      consequences of their deeds, and HE will admit them into Gardens through 
      which streams flow, to abide therein for ever. That is the supreme 
      achievement.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
