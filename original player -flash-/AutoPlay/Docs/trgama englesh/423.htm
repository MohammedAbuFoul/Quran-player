    <TD>36. And it behoves not a believing man or a believing woman, when 
      ALLAH and HIS Messenger have decided a matter, that they should exercise 
      their own choice in the matter concerning them. And whoso disobeys ALLAH 
      and HIS Messenger, surely, strays away in manifest error. <BR>37. And call 
      to mind when thou didst say to him on whom ALLAH had bestowed favours and 
      on whom thou also hadst bestowed favours: `Keep thy wife to thyself, and 
      fear ALLAH,' and thou didst conceal in thy heart what ALLAH was going to 
      bring to light, and thou didst fear the people, whereas ALLAH has better 
      right that thou shouldst fear HIM. Then, when Zaid had accomplished his 
      want concerning her, WE joined her in marriage to thee, so that there may 
      be no difficulty for the believers with regard to marriage with the wives 
      of their adopted sons, when they have accomplished their wants concerning 
      them. And ALLAH's decree was bound to be fulfilled. <BR>38. No blame can 
      attach to the Prophet with respect to that which ALLAH has made incumbent 
      upon him. Such, indeed, was the way of ALLAH with those who have passed 
      before - and the command of ALLAH is a decree ordained - <BR>39. Those who 
      delivered the Messages of ALLAH and feared HIM, and feared none but ALLAH. 
      And sufficient is ALLAH as a reckoner. <BR>40. Muhammad is not the father 
      of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of ALLAH, and the seal of the 
      Prophets and ALLAH has full knowledge of all things. <BR>41. O ye who 
      believe ! remember ALLAH much; <BR>42. And glorify HIM morning and 
      evening. <BR>43. HE it is Who sends down HIS blessing on you, and HIS 
      angels pray for you, that HE may bring you forth from all kinds of 
      darkness into light. And HE is Merciful to the 
  believers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
