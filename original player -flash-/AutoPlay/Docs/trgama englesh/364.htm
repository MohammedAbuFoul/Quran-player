    <TD>44. Dost thou think that most of them hear or understand ? They are 
      like cattle - nay, they are worst than cattle in their behaviour. <BR>45. 
      Dost thou not see how thy Lord lengthens the shade ? And if HE had 
      pleased, HE could have made it stationary. Then WE make the position of 
      the sun an indicator thereof. <BR>46. Them WE draw it in towards 
      Ourselves, drawing in little by little. <BR>47. And HE it is Who has made 
      the night a covering for you, and Who has made sleep for rest, and HE has 
      made the day to rise up and work. <BR>48. And HE it is Who sends the winds 
      as glad tidings before HIS mercy, and WE send down pure water from the 
      clouds, <BR>49. That WE may thereby give life to a dead land, and give it 
      for drink to Our creation - cattle and men in large numbers. <BR>50. And 
      WE have expounded the Qur'an to them in diverse ways that they make take 
      heed, but most men would reject everything but disbelief. <BR>51. If WE 
      had pleased, WE could have surely raised a Warner in every city; <BR>52. 
      So obey not the disbelievers and strive against them by means of the 
      Qur'an with a mighty striving. <BR>53. And HE it is Who has caused the two 
      seas to flow, this palatable and sweet, and that salt and bitter; and 
      between them HE has placed a barrier and an insurmountable partition. 
      <BR>54. And HE it is Who has created man from Water, and has made for him 
      kindred by descent and kindred by marriage; and thy Lord is All-Powerful. 
      <BR>55. And they worship beside ALLAH that which can neither benefit them 
      nor harm them. And the disbeliever is ever opposed to the designs of HIS 
      Lord.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
