    <TD>44. Their greeting on the day, when they meet HIM, will be `Peace.' 
      And HE has prepared for them an honourable reward. <BR>45. O Prophet ! 
      truly WE have sent thee as a Witness and a Bearer of glad tidings, and a 
      Warner, <BR>46. And as a Summoner unto ALLAH by HIS command, and as a 
      light-giving Lamp. <BR>47. And announce to the believers the glad tidings 
      that they will have great bounty from ALLAH. <BR>48. And follow not the 
      disbelievers and the hypocrites, and overlook their annoying talk and put 
      thy trust in ALLAH; for ALLAH is sufficient as a guardian. <BR>49. O ye 
      who believe ! when you marry believing women and then divorce them before 
      you have touched them, then you have no right to reckon the period of 
      waiting with regard to them. So make some provision for them and send them 
      away in a handsome manner. <BR>50. O Prophet ! WE have made lawful to thee 
      thy wives whom thou hast paid their dowries, and those whom thy right hand 
      possesses from among those whom ALLAH has given thee as gains of war, and 
      the daughters of thy paternal uncle, and the daughters of thy paternal 
      aunts, and the daughters of thy maternal uncle, and the daughters of thy 
      maternal aunts who have emigrated with thee and any other believing woman 
      if she offers herself for marriage to the Prophet provided the Prophet 
      desires to marry her; this provision is only for thee, and not for other 
      believers - WE have already made known what WE have enjoined on them 
      concerning their wives and those whom their right hands possess - in order 
      that there may be no difficulty for thee in explaining the Law to them. 
      And ALLAH is Most Forgiving, 
Merciful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
