    <TD>45. And if ALLAH were to punish people for what they do, HE would not 
      leave a living creature on the surface of the earth; but HE gives them 
      respite until an appointed term; and when their appointed time comes they 
      find that ALLAH has all HIS servants well under HIS eyes. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. Ya Sin. <BR>2. By the Qur'an, full of wisdom, <BR>3. Thou art, indeed, 
      one of the Messengers, <BR>4. On the right path. <BR>5. This is a 
      revelation from the Mighty, the Merciful. <BR>6. That thou mayest warn a 
      people whose fathers were not warned, and so they are heedless. <BR>7. 
      Surely, the word has proved true against most of them, for they believe 
      not. <BR>8. WE have put round their necks collars reaching unto their 
      chins, so that their heads are raised up. <BR>9. And WE have set a barrier 
      before them and a barrier behind them, and have covered them over, so that 
      they cannot see. <BR>10. Alike it is to them whether thou warn them or 
      warn them not; they will not believe. <BR>11. Thou canst warn only him who 
      would follow the Reminder and fear the Gracious God in secret. So give him 
      the glad tidings of forgiveness and a noble reward. <BR>12. Surely, WE 
      alone give life to the dead, and WE write down that which they send 
      forward and that which they leave behind; and all things WE have recorded 
      in a clear Book.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
