    <TD>216. Fighting is ordained for you, though it is repugnant to you; but 
      it may be that you dislike a thing while it is good for you, and it may be 
      that you like a thing while it is bad for you. ALLAH knows and you know 
      not.<BR>217. They ask thee about fighting in the Sacred Month. Say, 
      `Fighting therein is a heinous thing, but to hinder men from the way of 
      ALLAH, and to be ungrateful to HIM, and to hinder men from the Sacred 
      Mosque, and to turn out its people therefrom, is more heinous in the sight 
      of ALLAH; and persecution is worst than killing.' And they will not cease 
      fighting you until they turn you back from your Faith, if they can. And 
      whoso from among you turns back from his Faith and dies while he is a 
      disbeliever, it is they whose works shall be vain in this world and in the 
      next. These are the inmates of the Fire and therein shall they abide. 
      <BR>218. Those who believe and those who emigrate and strive hard in the 
      cause of ALLAH, it is these who hope for ALLAH's mercy; And ALLAH is Most 
      forgiving Merciful. <BR>219. They ask thee concerning wine and games of 
      chance. Say `In both there is great sin and harm and also some advantages 
      for men, but their sin and harm are greater than their advantage,' And 
      they ask thee what they should spend. Say, `Spend what you can spare.' 
      Thus does ALLAH makes HIS commandments clear to you that you may 
    reflect&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
