    <TD>104. And thou does not ask of them any reward for it. It is but a 
      source of honour for all mankind. <BR>105. And how many a Sign is there in 
      the heavens and the earth, which they pass by, turning away from it ! 
      <BR>106. And most of them believe not in ALLAH without at the same time 
      associating partners with HIM. <BR>107. Do they, then, feel secure from 
      the coming on them of an overwhelming punishment from ALLAH or the sudden 
      coming of the Hour upon them while they are unaware ? <BR>108. Say, `This 
      my way; I call unto ALLAH standing on sure knowledge, - I and those who 
      follow me. Holy is ALLAH, and I am not of those who associate gods with 
      ALLAH. <BR>109. And WE sent not before thee as Messengers any but men to 
      whom WE sent revelation, from among the people of the towns. Have they not 
      then traveled in the earth so that they should see what was the end of 
      those before them ? And surely, the abode of the Hereafter is better for 
      those who fear ALLAH. Will you not then use you understanding ? <BR>110. 
      And when the Messengers despaired of the disbelievers and the disbelievers 
      were convinced that they had been told only lies, Our help came to the 
      Messengers, and then were saved those whom WE please. And Our chastisement 
      cannot be averted from the sinful people. <BR>111. Assuredly, in their 
      narrative is a lesson for men of understanding. It is not a thing that has 
      been forged, but a fulfillment of that which is before it and a detail 
      exposition of all things, and a guidance and a mercy to people who 
      believe.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
