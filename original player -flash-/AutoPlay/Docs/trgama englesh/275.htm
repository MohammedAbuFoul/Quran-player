    <TD>73. And they worship beside ALLAH such as have no power to bestow on 
      them any gift from the heavens and the earth, nor can they ever have such 
      power. <BR>74. So coin not similitudes for ALLAH. Surely ALLAH knows and 
      you know not. <BR>75. ALLAH sets forth for you the parable of a slave who 
      is owned, having no power over anything; and a free man whom WE have 
      provided with a fair provision from US and he spends thereof secretly and 
      openly. Are they equal ? Praise be to ALLAH. But most of them know not. 
      <BR>76. And ALLAH sets forth another parable of two men - one of them is 
      dumb, having no power over anything, and he is a burden on his master; 
      withersoever he sends him, he brings no good. Can he be equal to him who 
      enjoins justice and who is on the straight path ? <BR>77. And to ALLAH 
      belongs the knowledge of the unseen in the heavens and the earth; and the 
      matter of the coming of the promised Hour is but as the twinkling of an 
      eye, nay, it is nearer still. Surely, ALLAH has full power over all 
      things. <BR>78. And ALLAH has brought you forth from the wombs of your 
      mothers while you knew nothing, and gave you ears and eyes and hearts, 
      that you may be grateful. <BR>79. Do they not observe the birds held under 
      subjection in the vault of heaven ? None keeps them back save ALLAH. 
      Verily, in that are Signs for a people who 
believe.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
