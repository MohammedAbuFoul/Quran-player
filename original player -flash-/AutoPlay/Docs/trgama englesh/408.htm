    <TD>33. And when an affliction befalls people, they cry unto their Lord, 
      turning sincerely to HIM; then, when HE has made them taste of mercy from 
      HIM, lo ! a section of them associate partners with their Lord, <BR>34. So 
      that they begin to deny that which WE have bestowed upon them. So enjoy 
      yourselves awhile but soon you will come to know. <BR>35. Have WE sent 
      down to them any authority which speaks in favour of what they associate 
      with HIM ? <BR>36. And when WE make people taste of mercy, they rejoice 
      therein; but if some evil befalls them because of that which their own 
      hands have sent on, behold ! they are in despair. <BR>37. See they not 
      that ALLAH enlarges the provision to whomsoever HE pleases and straitens 
      it to whomsoever HE pleases ? In that, truly, are Signs for a people who 
      believe. <BR>38. So give to the kinsman his due and to the needy and to 
      the wayfarer. That is best for those who seek the favour of ALLAH, and it 
      is they who will prosper. <BR>39. Whatever you lay out at interest that it 
      may increase the wealth of the people, it does not increase in the sight 
      of ALLAH; but whatever you give in Zakat, seeking the pleasure of ALLAH - 
      it is these who will increase their wealth manifold. <BR>40. It is ALLAH 
      Who has created you, and then HE has provided for you; then HE will cause 
      you to die, and then HE will bring you to life. Is there any of your 
      so-called associate-gods, who can do any of these things ? Glorified be HE 
      and exalted far above that which they associate with HIM. <BR>41. 
      Corruption have spread on land and sea because of what men's hands has 
      wrought, that HE may make them taste the fruit of some of their doings, so 
      that they may turn back from 
evil.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
