    <TD>31. Abraham said, `Now what is your errand, O ye who have been sent ?' 
      <BR>32. They said, `We have been sent to a sinful people, <BR>33. That we 
      may send down upon them stones of clay, <BR>34. Marked, with thy Lord, for 
      those guilty of excesses.' <BR>35. And we brought forth therefrom such of 
      the believers as were there. <BR>36. And WE found there only one house of 
      those who were obedient to US. <BR>37. And WE left therein a Sign for 
      those who fear painful punishment. <BR>38. And in the story of Moses also 
      there was a Sign when WE sent him to Pharaoh with clear authority. <BR>39. 
      But he turned away from Moses in pride of his might, and said, `A 
      sorcerer, or a madman.' <BR>40. So WE seized him and his hosts and threw 
      them into the sea; and he was to blame. <BR>41. And there was a Sign in 
      the story of the tribe of AD, when WE sent against them the destructive 
      wind; <BR>42. It spared nothing whatever that it came upon but made it 
      like a rotten bone. <BR>43. And a Sign there was in the story of the tribe 
      of Thamud when it was said to them, `Enjoy yourselves for a while.' 
      <BR>44. But they rebelled against the command of their Lord. So the 
      thunderbolt overtook them while they gazed; <BR>45. And they were not able 
      to rise up, nor were they able to defend themselves. <BR>46. And WE 
      destroyed the people of Noah before them; they were a disobedient people. 
      <BR>47. And WE have built the heavens with Our own hands, and, verily, WE 
      have vast powers. <BR>48. And the earth WE have spread out, and how 
      excellently do WE spread it out ! <BR>49. And of everything have WE 
      created pairs that you may reflect. <BR>50. Flee ye, therefore, unto 
      ALLAH. Surely, I am a plain Warner unto you from Him. <BR>51. And do not 
      set up another god along with ALLAH. Surely, I am a plain Warner unto you 
      from HIM.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
