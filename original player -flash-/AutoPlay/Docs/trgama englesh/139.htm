    <TD>91. And they do not make a just estimate of the attributes of ALLAH, 
      when they say, `ALLAH has not revealed anything to any man. Say, `Who 
      revealed the Book which Moses brought, a light and a guidance for the 
      people - though you treat it as scrapes of paper, some of which you show 
      while you hide much thereof and you have been taught that which neither 
      you nor your fathers knew ?' Say, `ALLAH.' Then leave them to amuse 
      themselves with idle talk. <BR>92. And this is a Book which WE have 
      revealed, full of blessings, to fulfill that which preceded it, and to 
      enable thee to warn the Mother of towns and those around her. And those, 
      who believe in the Hereafter, believe therein and they strictly observe 
      their Prayers. <BR>93. And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie 
      against ALLAH, or says, `It has been revealed to me,' while nothing has 
      been revealed to him; and who says, `I will sent down the like of that 
      which ALLAH has sent down ?' And if thou couldst only see, when the 
      wrongdoers are in the agonies of death, and the angels stretch forth their 
      hands, saying, `Yield up your souls. This day shall you be awarded the 
      punishment of disgrace because of that which you spoke against ALLAH 
      falsely and because you turned away from HIS Signs with disdain.' <BR>94. 
      And now you come to US one by one even as WE create you at first, and you 
      have left behind your backs that which WE bestowed upon you, and WE do not 
      see with you your intercessors of whom you asserted that they were 
      partners with ALLAH in your affairs. Now you have been cut off from one 
      another and that which you asserted has failed 
you.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
