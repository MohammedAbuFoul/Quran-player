    <TD>46. ALLAH said, `O Noah, he is surely not of thy family; he is indeed 
      a man of unrighteous conduct. So do not ask of ME that, of which thou hast 
      no knowledge, I admonish thee lest thou be one of the ignorant.' <BR>47. 
      Noah said, `My Lord, I beg Thee to protect me from asking Thee that 
      whereof I have no knowledge. And unless Thou forgive me and have mercy on 
      me, I shall be among the losers.' <BR>48. It was said, `O Noah, descend 
      then with peace from US and blessings upon thee and upon peoples to be 
      born of those with thee. And there will be other peoples whom WE shall 
      grant provision for a time, then shall a grievous punishment overtake them 
      from US.' <BR>49. This is of the tidings of the unseen which WE reveal to 
      thee. Thou didst not know them, neither thou nor thy people, before this. 
      So be thou patient; for the good end is for the God-fearing. <BR>50. And 
      to Ad, WE sent their brother, Hud. He said, `O my people worship ALLAH 
      alone. You have no God save Him. In associating other gods with Him you 
      but forge lies; <BR>51. `O my people, I do not ask of you any reward 
      therefor. My reward is only with HIM Who created me. Will you not then 
      understand ? <BR>52. `And O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord, then 
      turn to HIM, HE will send over you clouds pouring down abundant rain, and 
      will add strength to your strength. And turn not away from HIM, being 
      sinners.' <BR>53. They said, `O Hud, thou hast not brought us any clear 
      proof, and we are not going to forsake our gods merely because of thy 
      saying, nor are we going to believe in 
thee;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
