    <TD>46. And WE caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow in their footsteps, 
      fulfilling that which was revealed before him in the Torah; and WE gave 
      him the Gospel which contained guidance and light, fulfilling that which 
      was revealed before him in the Torah; and a guidance and an admonition for 
      the God-fearing. <BR>47. And let the people of the Gospel judge according 
      to what ALLAH has revealed therein, and whoso judges not by what ALLAH has 
      revealed, these it is who are the transgressors. <BR>48. And WE have 
      revealed unto thee the Book comprising the truth and fulfilling that which 
      was revealed before it in the Book, and as a guardian over it. Judge, 
      therefore, between them by what ALLAH has revealed, and follow not their 
      evil desires, turning away from the truth which has come to thee. For each 
      of you WE prescribed a clear spiritual Law and a manifest way in secular 
      matters. And if ALLAH had enforced HIS will, HE would have made you all 
      one people, but HE wishes to try you by that which HE has given you. Vie 
      then with one another in doing good works. To ALLAH shall you all return; 
      then HE will inform you of that wherein you differed; <BR>49. And that 
      thou shouldst judge between them by that which ALLAH has revealed and 
      follow not their evil desires and be on thy guard against them, lest they 
      involve thee in trouble on account of a part of what ALLAH has revealed to 
      thee. But if they turn away, then know that ALLAH intends to punish them 
      for some of their sins. And indeed a large number of men are disobedient. 
      <BR>50. Do they then seek the judgment of the days of Ignorance. And who 
      is better than ALLAH as a judge for a people who have firm faith
