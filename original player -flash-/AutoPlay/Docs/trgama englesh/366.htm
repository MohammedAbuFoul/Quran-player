    <TD>68. And those who call not on any other god along with ALLAH, nor slay 
      a person whose slaying ALLAH has forbidden except for a just cause, nor 
      commit adultery - and he who does that shall meet the punishment of his 
      sin; <BR>69. Doubled for him shall be the punishment on the Day of 
      Resurrection, and he will abide therein disgraced - <BR>70. Except those 
      who repent, and believe and do righteous deeds, for as to these, ALLAH 
      will convert their evil deeds into good ones, and ALLAH is Most Forgiving, 
      Merciful. <BR>71. And those who repent and do righteous deeds, indeed turn 
      to ALLAH with true repentance; <BR>72. And those who bear not false 
      witness, and when they pass by anything vain, they pass by with dignity; 
      <BR>73. And those who, when they are reminded of the Signs of their Lord, 
      fall not down thereat deaf and blind; <BR>74. And those who say, `Our 
      Lord, grant us of our wives and children the delight of our eyes, and make 
      us a model for the righteous.' <BR>75. It is such as will be rewarded with 
      lofty chambers in Paradise, because they were steadfast, and they will be 
      received therein with greeting and peace, <BR>76. Abiding therein. 
      Excellent it is as a place of rest and as an abode. <BR>77. Say to the 
      disbelievers, `But for your prayer to Him my Lord would not care for you 
      at all. But now that you have rejected HIS Message, HIS punishment will 
      cleave to you.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
