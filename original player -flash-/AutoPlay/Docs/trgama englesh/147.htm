    <TD>143. And of the cattle HE has created eight mates - of the sheep two, 
      and of the goats two. Say, `Is it the two males HE has forbidden or the 
      two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain ? Inform me 
      with knowledge if you are truthful.' <BR>144. And of the camels two, and 
      of the oxen two. Say, `Is it the two males that HE has forbidden or the 
      two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain ? Were you 
      present when ALLAH enjoined this on you ?' Who is more unjust than he who 
      forges a lie against ALLAH that HE may lead men astray without knowledge ? 
      Surely, ALLAH guides not the unjust people. <BR>145. Say, `I find not in 
      what has been revealed to me aught forbidden to an eater who desires to 
      eat it, except it be that which dies of itself or blood poured forth, or 
      the flesh of swine - for all that is unclean - or what is profane, on 
      which is invoked the name of other than ALLAH. But whoso is driven by 
      necessity, being neither disobedient nor exceeding the limit, then, 
      surely, they Lord is Most Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>146. And to those who 
      are Jews WE forbade all animals having claws; and of the oxen and the 
      sheep and goats did WE forbid them their fats, save that which their backs 
      bear or the entrails or that which is mixed with the bones. With that did 
      WE recompense them for their rebellion. And most surely WE are 
    truthful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
