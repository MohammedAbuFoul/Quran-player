    <TD>1. Alif, Lam, Mim. <BR>2. These are the verses of the Book, full of 
      wisdom, <BR>3. A guidance and a mercy for those who do good, <BR>4. Those 
      who observe Prayer and pay the Zakat and who have firm faith in the 
      Hereafter. <BR>5. It is they who follow guidance from their Lord, and it 
      is they who shall prosper. <BR>6. And of men is he who takes idle tales in 
      exchange for guidance to lead men astray from the path of ALLAH, without 
      knowledge, and to make fun of it. For such there will be humiliating 
      punishment. <BR>7. And when Our Signs are recited to him, he turns away 
      disdainfully, as though he heard them not, as if there were a heaviness in 
      his ears. So announce to him a painful punishment. <BR>8. Surely, those 
      who believe and do good works - they will have Gardens of Delight, <BR>9. 
      Wherein they will abide. ALLAH has made a true promise; and HE is the 
      Mighty, the Wise. <BR>10. HE has created the heavens without any pillars 
      that you can see, and HE has placed in the earth firm mountains that it 
      may not quake with you, and HE has spread therein all kinds of creatures; 
      and WE have sent down water from the clouds, and have caused to grow 
      therein of every fine species. <BR>11. This is the creation of ALLAH. Now 
      show me what others beside HIM have created. Nay, but the wrongdoers are 
      in manifest error.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
