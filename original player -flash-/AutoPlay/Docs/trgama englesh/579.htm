    <TD>6. From a spring wherefrom the servants of ALLAH will drink - they 
      make it gush forth - a forceful gushing forth. <BR>7. They fulfill their 
      vow, and fear a day the evil of which is widespread. <BR>8. And they feed, 
      for love of HIM, the poor, the orphan and the prisoner; <BR>9. Assuring 
      them: `WE feed you to win ALLAH's pleasure only. We desire no reward nor 
      thanks from you. <BR>10. `Verily, we fear from our Lord a frowning, 
      distressful day.' <BR>11. So ALLAH will save them from the evil of that 
      day, and will grant them joy and happiness. <BR>12. And HE will reward 
      them for their steadfastness, with a Garden and raiments of silk, <BR>13. 
      Reclining therein upon couches, they will experience therein neither 
      excessive heat nor bitter cold. <BR>14. And its shades will be close over 
      them, and its clustered fruits will be brought within their easy reach. 
      <BR>15. And vessels of silver will be passed round among them, and goblets 
      <BR>16. Bright as glass but made of silver, which they will measure 
      according to their own measure. <BR>17. And therein will they be given to 
      drink a cup tempered with ginger, <BR>18. From a spring named Salsabil. 
      <BR>19. And there will wait upon them youths who will not age. When thou 
      seest them, thou thinkest them to be pearls scattered about. <BR>20. And 
      when thou seest, thou wilt see there a bliss and a vast kingdom. <BR>21. 
      On them will be garments of fine green silk and thick brocade. And they 
      will be made to wear bracelets of silver. And their Lord will give them to 
      drink a pure beverage. <BR>22. They will be told: `This is your reward, 
      and your effort is appreciated.' <BR>23. Surely, WE have revealed unto 
      thee the Qur'an piecemeal. <BR>24. So wait patiently for the judgment of 
      thy Lord and yield not to any sinful or ungrateful one among them, <BR>25. 
      And remember the name of thy Lord morning and 
evening,&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
