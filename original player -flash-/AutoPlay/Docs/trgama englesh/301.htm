    <TD>62. And when they had gone beyond that place, he said to his young 
      companion, `Bring us our morning meal. Surely, we have suffered much 
      fatigue on account of this journey of ours.' <BR>63. He replied, `Didst 
      thou see, when we betook ourselves to the rock for rest and I forgot the 
      fish - and none but Satan caused me to forget to mention it to thee - it 
      took its way into the sea in a marvelous manner ? <BR>64. He said, `That 
      is what we have been seeking.' So they both returned, retracing their 
      footsteps. <BR>65. Then they found a servant of OURS, upon whom WE had 
      bestowed mercy from US, and whom WE had taught knowledge from Ourselves. 
      <BR>66. Moses said to him, `May I follow thee on condition that thou teach 
      me some of the guidance which thou hast been taught ?' <BR>67. He replied, 
      `Thou canst not have patience with me; <BR>68. `And how can thou have 
      patience about the things the knowledge of which thou comprehendest not ?' 
      <BR>69. He said, `Thou wilt find me, if ALLAH please, patient and I shall 
      not disobey any command of thine.' <BR>70. He said, `Well, if thou wouldst 
      follow me, then ask me no questions about anything till I myself speak to 
      thee about it.' <BR>71. So they both set out till, when they embarked in a 
      boat, he made a hole in it. Moses said, `Hast thou made a hole in it to 
      drown those who are in it ? Surely, thou hast done a grievous thing.' 
      <BR>72. He replied, `Did I not tell thee that thou canst not have patience 
      with me ?' <BR>73. Moses said, `Take me not to task for what I forgot and 
      be not hard on me for this lapse of mine.' <BR>74. So they journeyed on 
      till when they met a young boy; he slew him. Moses said, `What ! hast thou 
      slain an innocent person without his having slain anyone ! Surely, thou 
      hast done a hideous thing.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
