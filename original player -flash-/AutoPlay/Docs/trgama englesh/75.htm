    <TD>187. And remember when ALLAH took a covenant from those who were given 
      the Book, saying, `You shall expound it to the people and not hide it.' 
      But they threw it away behind their backs, and bartered it for a paltry 
      price. Evil is that which they purchased. <BR>188. Think not that those 
      who exult in what they have done, and love to be praised for what they 
      have not done - think not that they are secure from punishment. They shall 
      suffer a grievous chastisement. <BR>189. And to ALLAH belongs the Kingdom 
      of the heavens and the earth; and ALLAH has the power over all things. 
      <BR>190. In the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the 
      alternation of the night and the day there are indeed Signs for men of 
      understanding.; <BR>191. Those who remember ALLAH standing, sitting, and 
      lying on their sides, and ponder over the creation of the heavens and the 
      earth; and say, `Our Lord, thou hast not created this universe in vain. 
      Holy art Thou; save us then from the punishment of the Fire; <BR>192. `Our 
      Lord, whomsoever THOU causest to enter the Fire, him THOU hast surely 
      disgraced. And the wrongdoers shall have no helpers; <BR>193. `Our Lord, 
      we have heard a Crier calling us unto faith, saying, `Believe ye in your 
      Lord,' and we have believed. Our Lord, forgive us, therefore, our sins and 
      remit from us our evils and in death join us with the righteous; <BR>194. 
      `Our Lord, give us what Thou hast promised to us through Thy Messengers; 
      and disgrace us not on the Day of Resurrection. Surely, Thou breakest not 
      Thy promise.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
