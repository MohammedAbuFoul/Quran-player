    <TD>1. Ta Sin. These are the verses of the Qur'an and an illuminating 
      Book, <BR>2. A guidance and good tidings to those who would believe, 
      <BR>34. Who observe Prayer and pay the Zak?t, and have firm faith in the 
      Hereafter. <BR>4. As to those who believe not in the Hereafter, WE have 
      made their deeds appear beautiful to them, so they wander blindly. <BR>5. 
      It is they who shall have a grievous torment, and they alone it is who 
      shall be the greatest losers in the hereafter. <BR>6. Verily, thou 
      receivest the Qur'an from the One Wise, All-Knowing. <BR>7. Call to mind 
      when Moses said to his family, `I perceive a fire. I will bring you from 
      there some news of great import, or I will bring you a flaming brand that 
      you may warm yourselves.' <BR>8. So when he came to it, he was called by a 
      voice, `Blessed is he who is in the fire and also those around it, and 
      glorified be ALLAH, the Lord of the worlds; <BR>9. `O Moses, verily, I am 
      ALLAH, the Mighty, the Wise; <BR>10. `Throw down thy rod.' And when he saw 
      it move as though it were a serpent, he turned back retreating and did not 
      look back, whereupon WE said, `O Moses, fear not. Verily, I am the One in 
      Whose presence the Messengers need have no fear; <BR>11. `As to those who 
      do wrong and then adopt good instead of evil; to them I am indeed Most 
      Forgiving, Merciful; <BR>12. And put thy hand into thy bosom; it will come 
      forth white without evil. This is among the nine Signs unto Pharaoh and 
      his people, for they are a rebellious people.' <BR>13. But when Our 
      sight-giving Signs came to them, they said, `This is manifest 
    magic.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
