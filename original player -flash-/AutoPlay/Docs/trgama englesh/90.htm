    <TD>75. And why should you not fight in the cause of ALLAH and for the 
      rescue of the weak men, women and children - who say, `Our Lord, take us 
      out of this town whose people are oppressors, and give us a friend from 
      Thyself and give us from Thyself a helper.' <BR>76. Those who believe 
      fight in the cause of ALLAH, and those who disbelieve fight in the cause 
      of the Evil One. Fight ye therefore, against the friends of Satan; surely 
      Satan's strategy is weak. <BR>77. Hast thou not seen those to whom it was 
      said : `Restrain your hands, observe Prayer, and pay the Zakat.' And when 
      fighting is prescribed for them, behold a section of them fear men as they 
      should fear ALLAH, or with still greater fear; and they say `Our Lord, why 
      hast thou prescribed fighting for us ? Wouldst Thou not grant us respite 
      yet a while ?' Say, `The benefit of this world is little and the Hereafter 
      will be better for him who fears ALLAH; and you shall not be wronged a 
      whit.' <BR>78. Wheresoever you may be, death will overtake you, even if 
      you be in strongly built towers. And if some good befalls them, they say, 
      `This is from ALLAH;' and if evil befalls them, they say, `This is from 
      thee.' Say, `All is from ALLAH.' What has happened to these people that 
      they would not try to understand anything ? <BR>79. Whatever of good comes 
      to thee is from ALLAH; and whatever of evil befalls thee is from thyself. 
      And WE have sent thee as a Messenger to all mankind. And sufficient is 
      ALLAH as a Witness.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
