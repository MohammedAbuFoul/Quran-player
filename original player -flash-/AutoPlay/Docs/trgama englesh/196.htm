    <TD>55. So let not their wealth nor their children excite thy wonder. 
      ALLAH only intends to punish them therewith in the present life and that 
      their souls may depart while they are disbelievers. <BR>56. And they swear 
      by ALLAH that they are indeed of you, while they are not of you, but they 
      are a cowardly people. <BR>57. If they could find a place of refuge, or 
      caves, or even a hole to enter, they would surely turn thereto, rushing in 
      uncontrollable haste. <BR>58. And among them are those who find fault with 
      thee with respect to the division of alms. If they are given thereof, they 
      are pleased; but if they are not given thereof, behold ! they are 
      indignant. <BR>59. And if they had been content with what ALLAH and HIS 
      Messenger had given them and had said, `Sufficient for us is ALLAH; ALLAH 
      will give us from HIS bounty, and so will HIS Messenger; to ALLAH do we 
      turn in supplication,' it would have been better for them. <BR>60. The 
      alms are only for the poor and the needy, and for those employed in 
      connections therewith, and for those whose hearts are to be reconciled, 
      and for the freeing of slaves, and for those in debt, and for the cause of 
      ALLAH, and for the wayfarer - an ordinance from ALLAH. And ALLAH is 
      All-Knowing, Wise. <BR>61. And among them are those who annoy the Prophet 
      and say, `He is all ear.' Say, `His giving ear to all is for your good; he 
      believes in ALLAH and believes the Faithful, and is a mercy for those of 
      you who believe.' And those who annoy the Messenger of ALLAH shall have a 
      grievous punishment.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
