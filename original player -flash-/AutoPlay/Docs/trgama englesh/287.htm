    <TD>50. Say, `Be ye stones or Iron, <BR>51. `Or created matter of any kind 
      which appears hardest in your minds, even then shall you be raised up.' 
      Then will they ask, `Who shall restore us to life ?' Say, `He who created 
      you the first time.' Still they will shake their heads at thee and say, 
      ``When will it be ?' Say, `May be, it is nigh, <BR>52. `It will be on the 
      day when HE will call you; Then you will respond praising HIM and you will 
      think that you have tarried in the world but a little while.' <BR>53. And 
      say to MY servants that they should always speak what is best. Surely, 
      Satan, stirs up discord among them. Surely, Satan is an open enemy to man. 
      <BR>54. Your Lord knows you best. If HE please, HE will have mercy on you; 
      or if HE please, HE will punish you. And WE have not sent thee to be a 
      keeper over them. <BR>55. And thy Lord knows best those that are in the 
      heavens and the earth. And WE exalted some of the Prophets over others and 
      to David WE gave a Book. <BR>56. Say, `Call on those whom you assert to be 
      gods besides HIM; then you will know that they have no power to remove 
      affliction from you nor to change your condition.' <BR>57. Those, whom 
      they call on, themselves seek nearness to their Lord - even those of them 
      who are nearest - and hope for HIS mercy, and fear HIS punishment. Surely 
      the punishment of thy Lord is a thing to be feared. <BR>58. There is not a 
      township but WE shall destroy it before the Day of Resurrection, or punish 
      it with a severe punishment. That is written down in a 
  Book.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
