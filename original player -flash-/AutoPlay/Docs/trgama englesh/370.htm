    <TD>61. And when the two host came in sight of each other, the companions 
      of Moses said, `We are surely caught.' <BR>62. `Never !' said he, `My Lord 
      is with me; HE will guide me to safety.' <BR>63. Then WE revealed to 
      Moses: `Strike the sea with thy rod.' Thereupon it parted and every part 
      looked like a huge mound. <BR>64. And WE made the others approach nearer. 
      <BR>65. And WE saved Moses and those who were with him. <BR>66. Then WE 
      drowned the others. <BR>67. In this, verily, there is a Sign; but most of 
      these would not believe. <BR>68. And surely thy Lord - HE is the Mighty,

      you have been worshiping - <BR>76. `You and your fathers before you, 
      <BR>77. `They are all enemies to me but it is the Lord of the worlds, 
      <BR>78. `Who has created me, and it is HE Who guides me; <BR>79. `And Who 
      gives me food and gives me drink; <BR>80. `And when I fall ill, it is HE 
      who restores me to health; <BR>81. `And Who will cause me to die, and then 
      bring me to life again; <BR>82. `And Who, I hope, will forgive me my 
      faults on the Day of Judgment; <BR>83. `My Lord, bestow wisdom on me and
