    <TD>69. And those who are righteous are not at all accountable for them, 
      but their duty is to admonish them that they may fear ALLAH. <BR>70. And 
      leave alone those who take their religion to be a sport and a pastime, and 
      whom worldly life has beguiled. And admonish people thereby lest a soul be 
      consigned to perdition for what it has earned. It shall have no helper nor 
      intercessor beside ALLAH; and even if it offer every ransom it shall not 
      be accepted from it. These are they who have been delivered over to 
      destruction for their own acts. They will have a drink of boiling water 
      and a grievous punishment, because they disbelieved. <BR>71. Say, `Shall 
      we call beside ALLAH, upon that which can neither profit us nor harm us, 
      and shall we be turn back on our heels after ALLAH guided us ? - Like one 
      whom the evil ones entice away, leaving him bewildered in the land, and 
      who has companions who call him to guidance, saying, `Come to us.' Say : 
      `Surely, the guidance of ALLAH is the only true guidance and we have been 
      commanded to submit to the Lord of all the worlds. <BR>72. And we have 
      been given the command: Observe Prayers and fear HIM;' and HE it is Whom 
      you shall all be gathered.' <BR>73. And HE it is Who created the heavens 
      and the earth in accordance with the requirements of wisdom; and on the 
      day when HE will say, `Be', it will be. HIS word is the truth, and HIS 
      will be the Kingdom on the day when the trumpet will be blown. HE is the 
      Knower of the unseen and the seen. And HE is the Wise, the 
    All-Aware.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
