    <TD>73. And WE made them leaders who guided people by Our command, and WE 
      sent revelation to them enjoining the doing of good works, and the 
      observance of Prayer, and the giving of alms. And US alone they worshiped. 
      <BR>74. And to Lot WE gave wisdom and knowledge. And WE saved him from the 
      city which practised abominations. They were indeed a wicked and 
      rebellious people. <BR>75. And WE admitted him to OUR mercy; surely he was 
      one of the righteous. <BR>76. And remember Noah when he cried to US 
      aforetime, and WE heard his prayer and delivered him and his family from 
      the great distress, <BR>77. And WE helped him against the people who 
      rejected OUR Signs. They were surely a wicked people; so WE drowned them 
      all. <BR>78. And remember David and Solomon when they exercised their 
      respective judgements concerning the crop, when the sheep of certain 
      people strayed therein by night, and WE were bearers of witness to their 
      judgment. <BR>79. WE gave Solomon the right understanding of the matter 
      and to each of them WE gave wisdom and knowledge. And WE subjected the 
      mountains and the birds to David to celebrate God's praises with him. And 
      it was WE WHO did all these things. <BR>80. And WE taught him the making 
      of coats of mail for you, that they might protect you from each other's 
      violence in your battles. Will you then be grateful ? <BR>81. And WE 
      subjected to Solomon the violent wind. It blew, at his bidding, toward the 
      land which WE had blessed. And WE have knowledge of all 
  things.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
