          <TD>1. O Prophet ! why dost thou forbid thyself that which ALLAH has 
            made lawful to thee. Thou seekest the pleasure of thy wives ? And 
            ALLAH is Most Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>2. ALLAH has, indeed, 
            enjoined on you the expiation of such of your oaths as would 
            occasion trouble, and ALLAH is your friend; and He is All-Knowing, 
            Wise. <BR>3. And when the Prophet confided a matter unto one of his 
            wives and she divulged it, and ALLAH informed him of it, he made 
            known to her part thereof, and avoided mentioning part of it. And 
            when he informed her of it, she said, `Who has informed thee of it 
            ?' He said, `The All-Knowing, the All-Aware God has informed me.' 
            <BR>4. Now if you two turn unto ALLAH repentant - and your hearts 
            are already so inclined - it will be better for you. But if you back 
            up one another against him, surely, ALLAH is his helper and Gabriel 
            and the righteous among the believers, and all the angels besides 
            are his helpers. <BR>5. Maybe, his Lord, if he divorces you, will 
            give him instead wives better than you - resigned, believing, 
            obedient, always turning to God, devout in worship, given to 
            fasting, both widows and virgins. <BR>6. O ye who believe ! Save 
            yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is men and 
            stones over which are appointed angels, stern and severe, who 
            disobey not ALLAH in what HE commands them and do as they are 
            commanded. <BR>7. O ye who disbelieve ! Make no excuse this day. You 
            are requited for what you did.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
