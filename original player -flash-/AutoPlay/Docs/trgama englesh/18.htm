    <TD>113. And the Jews say, `The Christians stand on nothing' and the 
      Christians say, `The Jews stand on nothing;' while they both read the same 
      book. Even thus said those, who had no knowledge, like what they say. But 
      ALLAH shall judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that 
      wherein they disagree.<BR>114. And who is more unjust than he who 
      prohibits the name of ALLAH being glorified in ALLAH's temples and strives 
      to ruin them ? It was not proper for such men to enter therein except in 
      fear. For them is disgrace in this world; and theirs shall be a great 
      punishment in the next.<BR>115. To ALLAH belongs the East and the West; so 
      whithersover you turn, there will be the face of ALLAH. Surely, ALLAH is 
      Bountiful, All-Knowing. <BR>116. And they say, `ALLAH has taken to Himself 
      a son.' Holy is HE ! Nay, everything in the Heavens and the earth belongs 
      to HIM. To HIM are all obedient. <BR>117. HE is the Originator of the 
      heavens and the earth. When HE decrees a thing, HE only says to it `Be,' 
      and it is. <BR>118. And those who have no knowledge say, `Why does ALLAH 
      not speak to us, or a Sign come to us direct ?' Likewise said those before 
      them what was similar to their saying. Their hearts are all alike. We have 
      certainly made the Signs plain for a people who firmly believe.<BR>119. We 
      have sent thee with the Truth, as a bearer of glad tidings and a Warner. 
      And thou wilt not be questioned concerning the inmates of 
  Hell.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
