    <TD>65. And if the People of the Book had believed and been righteous, WE 
      would surely have removed from them their evils and WE would surely have 
      admitted them into Gardens of bliss. <BR>66. And if they had observed the 
      Torah and the Gospel and what has been now sent down to them from their 
      Lord, they would, surely, have eaten of good things from above them and 
      from under their feet. Among them are a people who are moderate; but many 
      of them are such that evil is what they do. <BR>67. O Messenger ! convey 
      to the people what has been revealed to thee from thy Lord; and if thou do 
      it not, thou has not conveyed HIS Message. And ALLAH will protect thee 
      from men. Surely ALLAH guides not the disbelieving people. <BR>68. Say, `O 
      People of the Book, you stand on nothing until you observe the Torah and 
      the Gospel and what has now been sent down to you from your Lord.' And 
      surely what has been sent down to thee from thy Lord will increase many of 
      them in rebellion and disbelieve; so grieve not for the disbelieving 
      people. <BR>69. Surely those who believed, and the Jews, and the Sabians, 
      and the Christians - whoso believes in ALLAH and the Last Day and does 
      good deeds, on them shall come no fear, nor shall they grieve. <BR>70. 
      Surely WE took a covenant from the Children of Israel, and WE sent 
      Messengers to them. But every time there came to them a Messenger with 
      what their hearts desired not, they treated some as liars, and some they 
      sought to kill.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
