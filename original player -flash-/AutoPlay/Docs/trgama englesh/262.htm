    <TD>1. Alif Lam Ra. These are verses of the perfect Book and of the 
      illuminating Qur'an. <BR>2. Often do the disbelievers wish they Muslims. 
      <BR>3. Leave them alone that they may eat and enjoy themselves and that 
      vain hope may beguile them, but they will soon know. <BR>4. And never a 
      town have WE destroyed but there was for it a known decree. <BR>5. No 
      people can escape their doom by outstripping their appointed term, nor can 
      they remain behind. <BR>6. And they said, `O thou to whom this exhortation 
      has been sent down, thou art surely a madman, <BR>7. `Why dost thou not 
      bring angels to us, if thou art of the truthful ?' <BR>8. WE do not send 
      down angels but with the requirements of justice, and when WE do send 
      them, the disbelievers are not respited. <BR>9. Verily, it is WE Who have 
      sent down this Exhortation, and most surely WE are its Guardians. <BR>10. 
      And WE sent Messengers before thee among parties of ancient people. 
      <BR>11. And there never came to them a Messenger but they mocked at him. 
      <BR>12. Thus do WE cause this habit of mocking to enter into the hearts of 
      the sinful people. <BR>13. They believe not in this Qur'an, though the 
      example of the former peoples have gone before them. <BR>14. And even if 
      WE open to them a gate in heaven, and they kept ascending through it, 
      <BR>15. They would surely say, `Only our eyes are dazed; rather we are a 
      bewitched people'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
