    <TD>39. And of HIS signs is that thou seest the earth lying withered, but 
      when WE send down water on it, it stirs and swells with verdure. Surely, 
      HE, Who quickened it, can quicken the dead also. Verily, HE has power over 
      all things. <BR>40. Surely, those who distort Our Signs to seek deviation 
      therein, are not hidden from US. Is he , then, who is cast into the Fire 
      better, or he who comes to US in security on the Day of Resurrection ? Do 
      what you will. Surely, HE sees all that you do. <BR>41. Those who 
      disbelieve in the Reminder - the Qur'an - when it has come to them are the 
      losers. And truly, it is a mighty Book, <BR>42. Falsehood cannot approach 
      it either from before it nor from behind it. It is a revelation from the 
      Wise, the Praiseworthy. <BR>43. Nothing is said in opposition to thee but 
      what was said to the Messengers before thee. Thy Lord is, indeed, the 
      Master of great forgiveness; and also the master of painful chastisement. 
      <BR>44. And if WE had made it a Qur'an in a foreign tongue, they, surely, 
      would have said, `Why have not its verses been made clear ? What ! a 
      foreign tongue and an Arab Prophet ?' Say, `It is a guidance and a healing 
      for those who believe.' But as to those who believe not, there is a 
      deafness in their ears and to them it is blindness. They are, as it were, 
      being called from a far-off place. <BR>45. And indeed, WE gave Moses the 
      Book, but differences were created concerning it; and had it not been for 
      a word that had gone forth from thy Lord, the matter would have been 
      decided between them, and certainly they are in a disquieting doubt about 
      it. <BR>46. Whose does right, it is for the benefit of his own soul; and 
      whoso does evil, the burden thereof will be on it. And thy Lord is not in 
      the least unjust to HIS 
servants.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
