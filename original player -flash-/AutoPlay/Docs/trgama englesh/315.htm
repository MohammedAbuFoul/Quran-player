    <TD>52. Moses said, `The knowledge thereof is with my Lord preserved in a 
      Book. My Lord neither errs nor forgets; <BR>53. It is HE WHO has made the 
      earth for you a bed and has caused pathways for you to run through it; and 
      WHO sends down rain from the sky and thereby WE bring forth various kinds 
      of vegetation in pairs. <BR>54. `Eat ye and pasture your cattle. Verily, 
      in this are Signs for those endowed with reason.' <BR>55. From the earth 
      have WE have created you, and into it shall WE cause you to return, and 
      from it shall WE bring you forth a second time. <BR>56. And WE did show 
      Pharaoh Our Signs, all of them; but he rejected them and refused to 
      believe. <BR>57. He said, `Has thou come to us, O Moses, to drive us out 
      of our land by thy magic ? <BR>58. But we shall assuredly bring thee magic 
      the like thereof; so make an appointment between us and thyself which we 
      shall not fail to keep - neither we nor thou - at a place alike for us 
      both.' <BR>59. Moses said, `Your appointment shall be the day of the 
      festival and let the people be assembled when the sun is risen high.' 
      <BR>60. Then Pharaoh withdrew and concerted his plan and then came to the 
      place of appointment. <BR>61. Moses said to them, `Woe to you, forge not a 
      lie against ALLAH, lest HE destroy you utterly by some punishment and, 
      surely, he who forges a lie shall perish.' <BR>62. Then they argued their 
      affair among themselves and conferred in secret. <BR>63. They said, 
      `Certainly these two are magicians who seek to drive you out from your 
      land by their magic and to destroy your best way of life; <BR>64. 
      `Concert, therefore, your plan; and then come forward in a body. And, 
      surely, he who gains ascendancy this day shall 
  prosper.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
