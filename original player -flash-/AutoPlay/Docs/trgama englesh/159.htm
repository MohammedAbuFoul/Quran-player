    <TD>68. I deliver to you the messages of My Lord and I am to you a sincere 
      and faithful counsellor. <BR>69. `Do you wonder that an exhortation has 
      come to you from your Lord through a man from among yourselves, that he 
      may warn you ? And remember the time when HE made you heirs to HIS favours 
      after the people of Noah and increasingly endowed you with great physical 
      strength. Remember, then, the favours of ALLAH, that you may prosper.' 
      <BR>70. They said, `Hast thou come to us that we may worship ALLAH alone 
      and forsake what our fathers used to worship ? Bring us, then, that which 
      thou threatenest us with, if thou art of the truthful.' <BR>71. He 
      replied, `Indeed there have already fallen on you punishment and wrath 
      from your Lord. Do you dispute with me about names which you have named - 
      you and your fathers - for which ALLAH has sent down no authority ? Wait 
      then, I am with you among those who wait.' <BR>72. And WE saved him and 
      those who with him by Our mercy and WE cut off the last of the remnants of 
      those who rejected Our Signs and had not believed. <BR>73. And to Thamud 
      WE sent their brother Salih. He said, `O my people, worship ALLAH; you 
      have no god other than HIM. Verily, there has come to you a clear evidence 
      from your Lord - this she-camel of ALLAH, a Sign for you. So leave her 
      that she may feed in ALLAH's earth and do her no harm, lest a punishment 
      seize you;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
