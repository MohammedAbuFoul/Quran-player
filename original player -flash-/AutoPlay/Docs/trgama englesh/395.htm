    <TD>78. He said, `All this has been given to me because of the knowledge I 
      possess.' Did he not know that ALLAH had destroyed before him generations 
      that were mightier than he and greater in riches ? And the guilty shall 
      not be asked to offer an explanation of their sins. <BR>79. So he went 
      forth before his people in all his pomp. Those who were desirous of the 
      life of this world said, `Would that we had the like of what Korah has 
      been given ! Truly, he is the master of great fortune.' <BR>80. But those 
      who had been given knowledge said, `Woe unto you, ALLAH's reward is best 
      for those who believe and do good works; and it shall be granted to no one 
      except those who are steadfast.' <BR>81. Then WE caused the earth to 
      swallow him up and his dwelling; And he had no party to help him against 
      ALLAH, nor was he of those who can defend themselves. <BR>82. And those 
      who had coveted his position the day before began to say, `Ruin seize thee 
      ! it is indeed ALLAH Who enlarges the provisions for such of HIS servants 
      as HE pleases and straitens it for whom HE pleases. Had not ALLAH been 
      gracious to us, HE would have caused it to swallow us up also. Ah ! the 
      ungrateful never prosper.' <BR>83. This is the home of the Hereafter. WE 
      give it to those who seek not self-exaltation in the earth, nor 
      corruption. And the good end is for the righteous. <BR>84. He who does a 
      good deed shall have a reward better than that; and as for him who does an 
      evil deed - those who do evil deeds shall not be rewarded but according to 
      what they did.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
