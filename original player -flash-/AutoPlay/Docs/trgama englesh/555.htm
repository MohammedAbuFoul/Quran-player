    <TD>5. And when it is said to them `Come, that the Messenger of ALLAH ask 
      forgiveness for you,' they turn their heads aside, and thou seest them 
      holding back disdainfully while they are big with pride. <BR>6. For them 
      it is equal whether thou ask forgiveness for them, or ask not forgiveness 
      for them. ALLAH will never forgive them. Surely, ALLAH guides not the 
      rebellious people. <BR>7. They it is who say, `Spend not on those who are 
      with the Messenger of ALLAH that they may disperse and leave him;' while 
      to ALLAH belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the 
      Hypocrites understand not. <BR>8. They say, `If we return to Medina, the 
      one most exalted will, surely, drive out therefrom the one most mean,' 
      while true honour belongs to ALLAH and to HIS Messenger and the believers; 
      but the Hypocrites know not. <BR>9. O ye who believe ! let not your wealth 
      and your children divert you from the remembrance of ALLAH. And whoever 
      does so - it is they who are the losers. <BR>10. And spend out of that 
      which WE have given you before death comes upon one of you and he says, 
      `My Lord ! if only Thou wouldst respite me for a little while, then I 
      would give alms and be among the righteous.' <BR>11. And ALLAH will not 
      grant respite to a soul when its appointed time has come; and ALLAH is 
      Well-Aware of what you do.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
