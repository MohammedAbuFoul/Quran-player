    <TD>16. WE will brand him on the snout. <BR>17. WE will, surely, try them 
      as WE tried the owners of the garden when they vowed to each other that 
      they would, certainly, gather all its fruit in the morning. <BR>18. And 
      they made no exception and said not `If God Please.' <BR>19. Then a 
      visitation from thy Lord visited it while they were asleep; <BR>20. And 
      the morning found it like a garden cut down. <BR>21. So they called to one 
      another at the break of dawn, <BR>22. Saying, `Go forth early in the 
      morning to your field, if you would gather the fruit.' <BR>23. And they 
      set out talking to one another in low tones, <BR>24. Saying, `Let no poor 
      man today enter it while you are there.' <BR>25. Thus they went forth 
      early in the morning, determined to be niggardly, <BR>26. But when they 
      saw it, they said, `Surely, we have lost our way ! <BR>27. `Nay we have 
      been deprived of all our fruits.' <BR>28. The best among them said, `Did I 
      not say to you, why do you not glorify God ?' <BR>29. Thereupon, they 
      said, `Glory be to our Lord ! Surely, we have been wrongdoers.' <BR>30. 
      Then some of them turned to the others, reproaching one another. <BR>31. 
      They said, `Woe to us ! We were indeed, rebellious, <BR>32. `May be, if we 
      repent, our Lord will give us instead a better garden than this; we do 
      humbly entreat our Lord.' <BR>33. Such is the punishment of this world. 
      And, surely, the punishment of the Hereafter is greater. Did they but know 
      ! <BR>34. For the righteous, indeed, there are Gardens of Bliss with their 
      Lord. <BR>35. Shall WE, then, treat those who submit to US as WE treat the 
      guilty ? <BR>36. What is the matter with you ? How judge ye ? <BR>37. Have 
      you a book wherein you read, <BR>38. That you shall, surely, have in it 
      whatever you choose ? <BR>39. Or, have you taken any covenant binding on 
      US till the Day of Resurrection that you shall, surely, have whatever you 
      judge ? <BR>40. Ask them, which of them will vouch for that. <BR>41. Or, 
      have they any associate-gods ? Let them, then, produce their 
      associate-gods, if they are truthful. <BR>42. On the day when the truth 
      shall be laid bare and they will be called upon to prostrate themselves, 
      they will not be able to do 
so;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
