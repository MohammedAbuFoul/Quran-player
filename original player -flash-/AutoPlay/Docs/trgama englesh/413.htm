    <TD>20. Do you not see that ALLAH has pressed for you into service 
      whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and has completed 
      HIS favours on you, both visible and invisible ? And among men there are 
      some who dispute concerning ALLAH, without knowledge or guidance or an 
      illuminating Book. <BR>21. And when it is said to them, `Follow that which 
      ALLAH has revealed,' they say, `Nay, we shall follow that which we found 
      our fathers following.' What ! even though Satan was inviting them to the 
      punishment of the burning fire ? <BR>22. And he who submits himself wholly 
      to ALLAH, and is a doer of good, he has, surely, grasped a firm handle. 
      With ALLAH rest the end of all affairs. <BR>23. And as for him who 
      disbelieves, let not his disbelief grieve thee. Unto US is their return 
      and WE shall tell them that which they did. Surely, ALLAH knows full well 
      what is in the breasts. <BR>24. WE shall let them enjoy themselves for a 
      while; then shall WE drive them to a severe torment. <BR>25. And if thou 
      ask them, `Who has created the heavens and the earth ?' They will, surely, 
      answer, `ALLAH.' Say, `All praise belongs to ALLAH.' But most of them have 
      no knowledge. <BR>26. To ALLAH belongs whatever is in the heavens and the 
      earth. Verily, ALLAH is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy. <BR>27. And if all 
      the trees that are in the earth were pens, and the ocean - seven more 
      oceans to replenish it - were ink, the words of ALLAH would not be 
      exhausted. Surely, ALLAH is Mighty, Wise. <BR>28. Your creation and your 
      resurrection are only like the creation and resurrection of a single soul. 
      Verily, ALLAH is All-Hearing, 
All-Seeing.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
