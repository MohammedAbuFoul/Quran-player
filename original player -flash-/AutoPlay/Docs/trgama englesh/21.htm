    <TD>135. And they say, `Be ye Jews or Christians, then you will be rightly 
      guided,' Say `Nay, but follow ye the religion of Abraham who was ever 
      inclined to ALLAH; he was not of those who associated gods with ALLAH.' 
      <BR>136. Say ye, `We believe in ALLAH and what has been revealed to us, 
      and what was revealed to Abraham and Ishmael, and Isaac and Jacob and his 
      children and what was given to Moses and Jesus, and what was given to all 
      other Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of 
      them; and to HIM we submit ourselves.'<BR>137. And if they believe as you 
      have believed, then they are rightly guided; but if they turn back, then 
      they are bent upon creating a schism, and ALLAH will surely suffice thee 
      against them, for HE is All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. <BR>138. Say, `We 
      have adopted the religion of ALLAH; and who is better than ALLAH in 
      teaching religion, and him alone do we worship.'<BR>139. Say, `Do you 
      dispute with us concerning ALLAH, while HE is our Lord and your Lord ? And 
      for us is our works and for you your works; and to HIM alone are we 
      sincerely devoted.' <BR>140. Do you say that Abraham and Ishmael, and 
      Isaac and Jacob and his children were Jews or Christians ?' Say `Do you 
      know better or ALLAH and who is more unjust than he who hides the 
      testimony that he has from ALLAH ? And ALLAH is not unaware of what you 
      do.' <BR>141. Those are a people that have passed away, for them is what 
      they have earned, and for you is what you earn, and you shall not be 
      questioned as to what they did.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
