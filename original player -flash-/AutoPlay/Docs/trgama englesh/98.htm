    <TD>122. But as for those who believe and do good works, WE will admit 
      them into Gardens, beneath which streams flow, wherein they will abide 
      forever. It is ALLAH's unfailing promise; and who can be more truthful 
      than ALLAH in word ? <BR>123. It shall not be according to your desires, 
      nor according to the desires of the People of the Book. Whoso does evil 
      shall be requited for it; and he shall find for himself no friend or 
      helper besides ALLAH. <BR>124. But whoso does good works, whether male or 
      female, and he or she is a believer, such shall enter heaven, and shall 
      not be wronged even as much as the little hollow in the back of a 
      date-stone. <BR>125. And who is better in faith than he who submits 
      himself entirely to ALLAH, and he is a doer of good and follows the 
      religion of Abraham ? And ALLAH took Abraham for a special friend. 
      <BR>126. And to ALLAH belongs all that is in the heavens and that is in 
      the earth; and ALLAH encompasses all things. <BR>127. And they seek of 
      thee the decision of the law concerning marriage with more women than one. 
      Say, ALLAH gives you His decision concerning them. And that which is 
      recited to you elsewhere in your Book concerns the orphan girls whom you 
      give not what is prescribed for them and whom you desire to marry, and 
      also concerns the weak among children. And HE enjoins you to deal 
      equitably with the orphans. And whatever good you do, surely ALLAH knows 
      it well. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
