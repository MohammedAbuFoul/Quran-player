    <TD>65. They said, `O Moses, either do thou cast first, or we shall be the 
      first to cast.' <BR>66. Moses said, `Nay, cast ye.' Then lo ! their cords 
      and their staves appeared to him, by their magic, as though they ran 
      about. <BR>67. And Moses conceived a fear in his mind. <BR>68. WE said, 
      `Fear not, for thou wilt have the upper hand; <BR>69. `And cast that which 
      is in thy right hand; it will swallow that which they have wrought, for 
      that which they have wrought is only a sorcerer's trick. And a sorcerer 
      shall not thrive, contrive what he may.' <BR>70. Then the realization of 
      truth made the sorcerers fall down prostrate. They said, `We believe in 
      the Lord of Aaron and Moses.' <BR>71. Pharaoh said, `Do you believe in him 
      before I give you leave ? He must be your chief who has taught you magic. 
      I will, therefore, surely cut off your hands and your feet on alternate 
      sides, and I will surely crucify you on the trunks of palm trees; and you 
      shall know which of us can impose severer and more abiding punishment.' 
      <BR>72. They said, `We shall not prefer thee to the manifest Signs that 
      have come to us, nor shall we prefer thee to HIM Who has created us. So 
      decree what thou wilt decree; thou canst only decree concerning this 
      present life; <BR>73. `Surely, we have believed in our Lord that HE may 
      forgive us our sins and forgive us the magic which thou didst force us to 
      practise. And ALLAH is the Best and the Most Abiding.' <BR>74. Verily, he 
      who comes to his Lord a sinner - for him is Hell; he shall neither die 
      therein nor live. <BR>75. But he who comes to him a believer, having done 
      good deeds, for such are the highest ranks - <BR>76. Gardens of Eternity, 
      beneath which streams flow; they will abide therein for ever. And that is 
      the recompense of those who keep themselves 
pure.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
