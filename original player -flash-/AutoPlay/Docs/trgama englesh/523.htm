    <TD>52. Even so there came no Messenger to those before them, but they 
      said, `A sorcerer or a madman.' <BR>53. Have they bequeathed this attitude 
      to one another ? Nay, they are all a rebellious people. <BR>54. So turn 
      away from them; and thou will not be to blame for what they do. <BR>55. 
      And keep on exhorting; for, verily, exhortation benefits those who would 
      believe. <BR>56. And I have not created the jinn and the men but that they 
      may worship ME. <BR>57. I desire of them no provision, neither do I desire 
      that they should feed ME. <BR>58. Surely, it is ALLAH Himself Who is the 
      Great Sustainer, the Lord of Power, the Strong. <BR>59. So the fate of 
      those who do wrong shall, surely, be like the fate of their fellows of 
      old; so let them not challenge ME to hasten on the punishment. <BR>60. 
      Woe, then, to those who disbelieve, because of that day of theirs which 
      they have been promised.<BR>&nbsp;

      unfolded; <BR>4. And by the ever Frequented House; <BR>5. And by the 
      Elevated Roof; <BR>6. And by the Swollen Sea; <BR>7. The punishment of thy 
      Lord shall, certainly, come to pass. <BR>8. There is none to avert it. 
      <BR>9. On the day when the heaven will be in a state of terrific 
      commotion, <BR>10. And the mountains shall move fast, <BR>11. Then woe 
      that day to those who reject the Truth, <BR>12. Who sportingly indulge in 
      idle talk; <BR>13. The day when they shall be trust into the fire of Hell 
      with a violent trust. <BR>14. And they will be told: `This is the Fire 
      which you denied as a lie,&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
