    <TD>36. And how many a generation, who were mightier than they in prowess, 
      have WE destroyed before them ! But when the punishment came, they went 
      about in the lands, devising plans to escape it. But was there any place 
      of refuge for them ? <BR>37. Therein, verily, is a reminder for him who 
      has an understanding heart, or, who gives ear and is attentive. <BR>38. 
      And, verily, WE created the heavens and the earth and all that is between 
      them in six periods and no weariness touched US. <BR>39. So bear with 
      patience what they say, and celebrate the praises of thy Lord, before the 
      rising of the sun and before its setting; <BR>40. And in parts of the 
      night also do thou glorify HIM, and after the prescribed prostrations. 
      <BR>41. Hearken ! On the day when the caller will call from a place 
      nearby, <BR>42. The day when they will hear the inevitable blast; that 
      will be the day of coming forth from the graves. <BR>43. Verily, it is WE 
      Who give life and cause death, and to US is the final return. <BR>44. On 
      the day when the earth will cleave asunder and in consequence of their 
      misdeeds they will come forth hastening - that will be a raising up of the 
      dead easy for US. <BR>45. WE know best what they say; and thou art not to 
      compel them in any way. So admonish, by means of the Qur'an, him who fears 
      MY warning. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. By those that scatter with a true scattering, <BR>2. Then carry the 
      load, <BR>3. Then speed lightly along, <BR>4. And then distribute by Our 
      command, <BR>5. Surely, that which you are promised is true, <BR>6. And 
      Judgment will, surely, come to 
pass.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
