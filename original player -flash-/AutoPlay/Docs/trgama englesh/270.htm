    <TD>27. The on the Day of Resurrection HE will humiliate them and will 
      say, `Where are my partners for whose sake you used to oppose My Prophets 
      ?' Those endowed with knowledge will say, `This day humiliation and 
      affliction will surely befall the disbelievers.' <BR>28. Those on whom the 
      angels cause to die while they are wronging their souls, will offer 
      submission pleading, `We use not to do any evil.' It will be said to them, 
      `Nay, surely, ALLAH knows well what you used to do, <BR>29. `So enter the 
      gates of Hell, to abide therein. Evil indeed is the abode of the 
      arrogant.' <BR>30. And when it is said to the righteous, `What say ye of 
      that which your Lord has revealed ?' They say, `The best.' For those who 
      do good, there is good in this world, and the home of the Hereafter is 
      even better. Excellent indeed is the abode of the righteous, <BR>31. 
      Gardens of Eternity, which they will enter; through them flow streams. 
      They will have therein what they wish for. Thus does ALLAH reward the 
      righteous,' <BR>32. Those whom the angels cause to die while they are 
      pure, they say to them, `Peace be unto you. Enter Heaven because of what 
      you used to do.' <BR>33. What do these disbelievers wait for except that 
      the angels should come upon them or that the decree of thy Lord should 
      come to pass ? So did those who were before them. ALLAH did not wrong 
      them, but they used to wrong themselves. <BR>34. So the evil consequences 
      of what they did overtook them and that which they used to mock at 
      encompassed them.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
