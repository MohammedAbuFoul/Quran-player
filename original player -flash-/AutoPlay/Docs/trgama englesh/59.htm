    <TD>71. O People of the Book ! Why do you confound truth with falsehood 
      and hide the truth knowingly ? <BR>72. And a party of the People of the 
      Book say, `Declare your belief outwardly in that which has been revealed 
      unto the believers, in the early part of the day, and disbelieve in the 
      latter part of thereof; perchance they may return. <BR>73. And obey none 
      but him who follows your religion.' Say, `Surely, true guidance - the 
      guidance of ALLAH, - is, that one be given the like of that which has been 
      given to you - or they would argue with you before your Lord.' Say, `All 
      grace is in the hand of ALLAH. HE gives it to whomsoever HE pleases. And 
      ALLAH is Bountiful, All-knowing. <BR>74. `HE selects for HIS mercy 
      whomsoever HE pleases. And ALLAH is the Lord of mighty grace. <BR>75. 
      Among the People of the Book there is he who, if thou trust him with a 
      treasure, will return it to thee; and among them is he who, if thou trust 
      him with a dinar, will not return it to thee, unless thou keep standing 
      over him. That is because they say, `We are not liable to be called to 
      account in the matter of the Unlearned people; and they utter a lie 
      against ALLAH knowingly. <BR>76. Nay, but whoso fulfills his pledge and 
      fears ALLAH -verily, ALLAH loves those who fear Him. <BR>77. As for those 
      who take a paltry price in exchange for their covenant with ALLAH and 
      their oaths, they shall have no portion in the life to come, and ALLAH 
      will neither speak to them nor look upon them on the Day of Resurrection, 
      nor will HE purify them; and for them shall be a grievous 
    punishment.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
