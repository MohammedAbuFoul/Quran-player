    <TD>54. And, surely, WE have explained in various ways in this Qur'an for 
      the good of mankind all manner of similitudes, but of all things man is 
      most contentious. <BR>55. And nothing hinders people from believing when 
      the guidance comes to them, and from asking forgiveness of their Lord, but 
      that they wait for the fate of the ancients to overtake them or that 
      punishment should come upon them face to face. <BR>56. And WE sent not the 
      Messengers but as bearers of glad tidings and as Warners. And those who 
      disbelieve content by means of falsehood that they may rebut the truth 
      thereby. And they take MY Signs and what they are warned of only a jest. 
      <BR>57. And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the Signs of his 
      Lord, but turns away from them, and forgets what his hands have sent 
      forward ? Verily, WE have placed veils over their hearts that they 
      understand it not and in their ears a deafness. And if thou call them to 
      guidance, they will never accept it. <BR>58. And thy Lord is Most 
      Forgiving, Lord of Mercy. If HE were to seize them for what they have 
      earned, then surely HE would have hastened the punishment for them. But 
      they have an appointed time from which they will find no refuge <BR>59. 
      And these towns - WE destroyed them when they committed iniquities. And WE 
      appointed a time for their destruction. <BR>60. And remember the time when 
      Moses said to his young companion, `I will not cease pursuing my course 
      until I reach the junction of the two seas, though I may have to journey 
      on for ages. <BR>61. But when they reached the place where the two seas 
      met, they forgot their fish and it made its way into the sea going away 
      quickly.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
