    <TD>128. And if a women fears ill treatment or indifference from her 
      husband, it shall be no sin that they be suitably reconciled to each 
      other; and reconciliation is best. And people are prone to covetousness. 
      And if you do good and are righteous, surely ALLAH is Aware of what you 
      do. <BR>129. And you cannot keep perfect balance between wives, however 
      much you may desire it. But incline not wholly to one so that you leave 
      the other like a thing suspended. And if you are reconciled and act 
      righteously, surely ALLAH is Most Forgiving, and Merciful. <BR>130. And if 
      they separate, ALLAH will make both independent out of HIS abundance, and 
      ALLAH is Bountiful, Wise. <BR>131. And to ALLAH belongs whatever is in the 
      heavens and whatever is in the earth. And WE have assuredly commanded 
      those who were given the Book before you and commanded you also to fear 
      ALLAH. But if you disbelieve, then remember that to ALLAH belongs whatever 
      is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and ALLAH is 
      Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy. <BR>132. And to ALLAH belongs whatever is 
      in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and sufficient is ALLAH as a 
      Guardian. <BR>133. If HE please, HE can take you away, O people, and bring 
      others in your stead; and ALLAH has the full power to do that. <BR>134. 
      Whoso desires the reward of this world, then let him know that with ALLAH 
      is the reward of this world and of the hereafter; and ALLAH is 
      All-Hearing, All-Seeing.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
