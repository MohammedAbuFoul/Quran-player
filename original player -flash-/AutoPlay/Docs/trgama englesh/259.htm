    <TD>25. It brings forth its fruit at all times by the command of its Lord. 
      And ALLAH sets forth parables for men that they may be reminded. <BR>26. 
      And the case of an evil word, is like that of an evil tree, which is 
      uprooted from above the earth and has no stability. <BR>27. ALLAH 
      strengthens the believers with the word that is firmly established, both 
      in the present life and in the Hereafter; and ALLAH lets the wrongdoers go 
      astray. And ALLAH does what HE wills. <BR>28. Dost thou not see those who 
      changed ALLAH's favour for ingratitude and landed their people into the 
      abode of ruin <BR>29. Into Hell. They shall burn therein; and an evil 
      place of rest it is. <BR>30. And they have set up rivals to ALLAH to lead 
      people astray from HIS way. Say, `Enjoy yourselves a while, then, surely, 
      your journey is toward the Fire.' <BR>31. Say to My servants who believe 
      that they should observe Prayer, and spend out of what WE have given them, 
      secretly and openly, before there comes a day where there will be neither 
      bargaining nor friendship. <BR>32. ALLAH is HE Who created the heavens and 
      the earth and caused water to come down from the clouds, and brought forth 
      therewith fruits for your sustenance, and HE has subjected to you the 
      ships that they may sail through the sea by HIS command, and the rivers 
      too has HE subjected to you. <BR>33. And HE has also subjected to you the 
      sun and the moon, both performing their functions constantly. And HE has 
      subjected to you the night as well as the 
day.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
