    <TD>71. He said, `These are my daughters who are guarantee enough if you 
      must do something.' <BR>72. By the life, they, too, in their mad 
      intoxication of wandering in distraction. <BR>73. Then the punishment 
      seized them at sunrise. <BR>74. `We turned their town upside down and WE 
      rained upon them stones of clay. <BR>76. And that town lies on a road that 
      still exists. <BR>77. Surely, in this is a Sign for believers. <BR>78. And 
      the people of the Wood, too, were surely wrongdoers. <BR>79. So WE 
      chastised them also. And they both lie on an open highway. <BR>80. And the 
      People of the Hijr also treated the Messengers as liars. <BR>81. And WE 
      gave them Our Signs, but they turned away from them. <BR>82. And they used 
      to hew out houses in the mountains, in security. <BR>83. But the 
      punishment seized them in the morning, <BR>84. And all they had earned 
      availed them not. <BR>85. And WE have not created the heavens and the 
      earth and all that is between the two but in accordance with the 
      requirements of wisdom; and the Hour is sure to come. So do thou forbear 
      with goodly forbearance. <BR>86. Verily, it is thy Lord WHO is the Great 
      Creator, the All-Knowing. <BR>87. And WE have indeed given the seven 
      oft-repeated verses, and the great Qur'an. <BR>88. Stretch not thine eyes 
      towards what WE have bestowed on some classes of them for temporary 
      enjoyment and grieve not for them; and lower thy wing of mercy for the 
      believers. <BR>89. And say, `I am indeed a plain Warner.' <BR>90. Because 
      WE have decided to send down punishment on those who have formed 
      themselves into groups against 
thee;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
