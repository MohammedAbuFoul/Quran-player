    <TD>1. Glory be to HIM WHO carried HIS servant by night from the Sacred 
      Mosque to the Distant Mosque, the environs of which WE have blessed, that 
      WE might show him some of OUR Signs. Surely, HE alone is the All-Hearing, 
      the All-Seeing. <BR>2. And WE gave Moses the Book and WE made it a 
      guidance for the Children of Israel, commanding, `Take ye no guardian 
      beside ME, <BR>3. `O ye, the progeny of those whom WE carried in the Ark 
      with Noah.' He indeed was a grateful servant of OURS. <BR>4. And WE had 
      clearly conveyed to the Children of Israel in the Book: `You will surely 
      do great mischief in the land twice, and you will surely become 
      excessively overbearing.' <BR>5. So when the time of the fulfillment of 
      the first of the two warnings came, WE sent against you some servants of 
      OURS, possessed of great might in war, and they penetrated into your 
      houses and it was a warning that was bound to be fulfilled. <BR>6. Then WE 
      gave you back the power against them and aided you with wealth and 
      children and also made you larger in numbers than before. <BR>7. Now, if 
      you do good, you will do good for your own souls; and if you do evil, it 
      will be to your own loss. So when the time for the fulfillment of the 
      latter warning came, WE raised a people against you that they might cover 
      your faces with grief, and that they enter the Mosque, as they entered it 
      the first time, and that they might destroy utterly all that they 
      conquered.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
