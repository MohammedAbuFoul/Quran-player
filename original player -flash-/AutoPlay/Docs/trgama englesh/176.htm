    <TD>196. `Truly my Protector is ALLAH Who revealed this Book. And HE 
      protects the righteous. <BR>197. And they whom you call besides HIM have 
      no power to help you, nor can they help themselves;' <BR>198. And if you 
      invite them to guidance, they hear not. And thou seest them looking 
      towards thee, but they see not. <BR>199. Do thou ever forebear, O Prophet 
      ! and enjoin kindness, and turn away from the ignorant. <BR>200. And if an 
      evil suggestion of Satan assail thee, then seek refuge in ALLAH; surely, 
      HE is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. <BR>201. As to those who are righteous, 
      when an evil suggestion from Satan assails them, they remember ALLAH and 
      behold ! they begin to see aright. <BR>202. And the brethren of the 
      disbelievers draw them into error and then they relax not their efforts. 
      <BR>203. And when thou bringest not to them a fresh Sign, they say, `Why 
      hast thou not forged one ?' Say, `I follow only that which is revealed to 
      me from my Lord. These are clear proofs from your Lord and guidance and 
      mercy for a people who believe.' <BR>204. And when the Qur'an is recited, 
      give ear to it and keep silence, that you may be shown mercy. <BR>205. And 
      remember thy Lord in thy mind humbly and fearing HIM, and in a low voice 
      in the mornings and evenings; and be not of the heedless. <BR>206. Truly 
      those who are near to thy Lord, turn not away with pride from HIS worship, 
      but they glorify HIM and prostrate themselves before 
  HIM.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
