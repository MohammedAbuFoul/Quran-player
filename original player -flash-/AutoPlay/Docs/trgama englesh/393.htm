    <TD>60. And whatever of anything you are given is only a temporary 
      enjoyment of the present life and an adornment thereof; and that which is 
      with ALLAH is better and more lasting. Will you not then understand ? 
      <BR>61. Is he, then, to whom WE have promised a goodly promise, the 
      fulfillment of which he will meet, like him whom WE have provided with the 
      good things of this life only, and then on the Day of Resurrection he will 
      be among those who are brought before God to give an account of their 
      deeds ? <BR>62. And on that day HE will call to them, and say, `Where are 
      those whom you allege to be my associates ?' <BR>63. Then those, against 
      whom the sentence of punishment will have become due, will say, `Our Lord, 
      these are those whom we led astray. We led them astray even as we had gone 
      astray ourselves. We now dissociate ourselves from them and turn to Thee. 
      It was not us that they worshiped.' <BR>64. And it will be said to the 
      idolaters, `Now call upon your so-called partners.' And they will call 
      upon them, but they will not answer them. And they will see the punishment 
      and wish that they had followed the guidance. <BR>65. And on that day 
      ALLAH will call to them and say, `What answer gave you to the Messengers 
      ?' <BR>66. Then all excuses will become obscure to them on that day and 
      they shall not even ask each other. <BR>67. But he who repents and 
      believes and does righteous deeds, maybe, he will be among the prosperous. 
      <BR>68. And thy Lord creates whatever HE pleases, and chooses whomsoever 
      HE pleases. It is not for them to choose. Glorified be ALLAH. HE is far 
      above all that they associate with HIM. <BR>69. And thy Lord knows what 
      their breasts conceal, and what they disclose. <BR>70. And HE is ALLAH; 
      there is no god but HE. To HIM belongs all praise in the beginning and the 
      Hereafter. HIS is the dominion, and to HIM shall you be brought 
    back.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
