    <TD>5. And if they had waited patiently until thou camest out to them, it 
      would be better for them. But ALLAH is Most Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>6. O 
      ye who believe ! if an unrighteous person brings you any news, investigate 
      it fully, lest you harm a people in ignorance, and then you repent of what 
      you did. <BR>7. And know that among you is the Messenger of ALLAH; if he 
      were to follow your wishes in many matters, you would, surely, come to 
      trouble; but ALLAH has endeared the faith to you and has made it look 
      beautiful to your hearts, and HE has made disbelief, wickedness and 
      disobedience hateful to you. Such, indeed, are those who follow the right 
      course <BR>8. By ALLAH's grace and HIS favour. And ALLAH is ALL-Knowing, 
      Wise. <BR>9. And if two parties of believers fight each other, make peace 
      between them; then if after that, one of them transgresses against the 
      other, fight the party that transgress until it returns to the command of 
      ALLAH. Then if it returns, make peace between them with equity, and act 
      justly. Verily, ALLAH loves the just. <BR>10. Surely, all believers are 
      brothers. So make peace between your brothers, and fear ALLAH that mercy 
      may be shown to you. <BR>11. O ye who believe ! let not one people deride 
      another people, haply they may be better than they, nor let one group of 
      women deride other women, haply they may be better than they. And do not 
      defame your people nor call one another by nick-names. It is an evil thing 
      to be called by bad name after having believed; and those who repent not, 
      such are the wrongdoers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
