    <TD>16. And WE have, indeed, made mansions of stars in the heaven and have 
      adorned it for beholders. <BR>17. And WE have guarded it against the 
      intrusion of every rejected Satan. <BR>18. But if anyone hears stealthily 
      something of revelation and distorts it, there pursues him a bright flame. 
      <BR>19. And the earth have WE spread out, and set therein firm mountains 
      and cause every thing to grow therein in proper proportion. <BR>20. And WE 
      have made for you therein means of livelihood and also for all those for 
      whom you do not provide. <BR>21. And there is not a thing but are 
      limitless treasures thereof with US and WE sent it not down except in a 
      known measure. <BR>22. And WE send fecundating winds, then WE send down 
      water from the clouds, then WE give it to you to drink, and you could not 
      yourselves store it. <BR>23. And verily, it is WE Who give life, and WE 
      Who cause death; And it is WE Who are the sole Inheritors of ALL. <BR>24. 
      And WE do know those who go ahead among you and WE also do know those who 
      lag behind. <BR>25. And, surely, it is thy Lord Who will gather them 
      together. Surely, HE is Wise, All-Knowing. <BR>26. And, surely, WE created 
      man from dry ringing clay, of black mud wrought into shape. <BR>27. And 
      the jinn WE have created before of the fire of hot wind. <BR>28. And 
      remember when thy Lord said to the angels, I am about to create man of dry 
      ringing clay, of black mud wrought into shape: <BR>29. So when I fashioned 
      him in perfection and have breath into him of MY spirit, fall ye down in 
      submission to him.' <BR>30. So the angels submitted, all of them together. 
      <BR>31. But Iblis did not; he refused to be among those who 
    submit.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
