    <TD>26. `So, eat and drink and cool thine eye. And if thou seest any man, 
      say, `I have vowed a fast to the Gracious God; I will, therefore, not 
      speak this day to any human being.' <BR>27. Then she brought him to her 
      people, mounted. They said, `O Mary, surely, thou hast committed a 
      monstrous thing ! <BR>28. `O sister of Aaron, thy father was not a wicked 
      man, nor was thy mother an unchaste woman !' <BR>29. Thereupon she pointed 
      to him. They said, `How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle ?' 
      <BR>30. Jesus said, `I am a servant of ALLAH. HE has given me the Book, 
      and has made me a Prophet; <BR>31. `And HE has made me blessed wheresoever 
      I may be, and has enjoined upon me Prayer and almsgiving so long as I 
      live; <BR>32. `And HE has made me dutiful towards my mother, and has not 
      made me arrogant and graceless; <BR>33. `And peace was on me the day I was 
      born, and peace will be on me the day I shall die, and the day I shall be 
      raised up to life again.' <BR>34. That was Jesus, son of Mary. This is a 
      statement of the truth concerning which they entertain doubt. <BR>35. It 
      does not befit the Majesty of ALLAH to take unto Himself a son. Holy is 
      HE. When HE decrees a thing, HE says to it, `Be, and it comes into being.' 
      <BR>36. Said Jesus, `Surely, ALLAH is my Lord and your Lord, so worship 
      HIM alone, this is the right path.' <BR>37. But the parties differed among 
      themselves; so woe to those who disbelieve, because of the meeting of a 
      grievous day. <BR>38. How will they hear and see on the day when they will 
      come to US ! But today the wrongdoers are in manifest 
  error.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
