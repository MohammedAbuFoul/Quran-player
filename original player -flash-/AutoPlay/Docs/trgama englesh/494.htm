          <TD>61. But, verily, he was a sign of the Hour. So entertain no 
            doubt about it, but follow me. This is the right path. <BR>62. And 
            let not Satan hinder you, he is to you an open enemy. <BR>63. And 
            when Jesus came with clear proofs, he said, `Truly, I have come to 
            you with wisdom, and to make clear to you some of that about which 
            you differ. So fear ALLAH and obey me. <BR>64. `Verily, ALLAH - HE 
            is my Lord and your Lord. So worship HIM. This is the right path.' 
            <BR>65. But the parties differed among themselves. So woe to the 
            wrongdoers because of the punishment of a painful day ! <BR>66. They 
            wait not but for the Hour to come suddenly upon them, while they 
            perceive it not. <BR>67. Friends on that day will be foes to one 
            another, except the righteous; <BR>68. To them ALLAH will say, `O MY 
            servants, there is no fear for you this day, nor shall you grieve. 
            <BR>69. `You who believed in Our Signs and submitted, <BR>70. `Enter 
            ye the Garden, you and your wives, honoured and happy.' <BR>71. 
            There will be passed around to them dishes of gold and cups, and 
            therein will be all that the souls desire and in which the eyes 
            delight. And therein you will dwell forever. <BR>72. `And this is 
            the garden to which you have been made heirs because of what you 
            did. <BR>73. `Therein for you is fruit in abundance, of which you 
            will eat.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
