    <TD>77. And WE made his offspring the only survivors. <BR>78. And WE left 
      for him a good name among the later generations. <BR>79. Peace be upon 
      Noah among the peoples ! <BR>80. Thus, indeed, do WE reward those who do 
      good. <BR>81. He was, surely, one of our believing servants. <BR>82. Then 
      WE drowned the others. <BR>83. And, verily, of his party was Abraham; 
      <BR>84. When he came to his Lord with a pure heart; <BR>85. When he said 
      to his father and to his people, `What is it that you worship ? <BR>86. `A 
      lie - false gods beside ALLAH do you desire ? <BR>87. `What think ye of 
      the Lord of the worlds ?' <BR>88. Then he cast a glance at the stars, 
      <BR>89. And said, `I am feeling unwell.' <BR>90. So they went away from 
      him, turning their backs. <BR>91. The he went quietly to their gods and 
      addressing them said, `Will you not eat ? <BR>92. `What is the matter with 
      you that you speak not ?' <BR>93. The he turned upon them, striking them 
      with the right hand. <BR>94. Thereupon the people came towards him, 
      hastening. <BR>95. He said, `Do you worship that which you yourselves 
      carve out, <BR>96. `Whereas ALLAH has created you and also your handiwork 
      ?' <BR>97. They said, `Build for him a structure and cast him into the 
      fire.' <BR>98. Thus they designed an evil design against him, but WE made 
      them most humiliated. <BR>99. And he said, `I am going to my Lord. HE 
      will, surely, guide me.' <BR>100. And he prayed, `My Lord, grant me a 
      righteous son. <BR>101. So WE gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing 
      son. <BR>102. And when he was old enough to run along with him, he said, 
      `O my dear son, I have seen in a dream that I offer thee in sacrifice. So 
      consider what thou thinkest of it !' He replied, `O my father, do as thou 
      art commanded; thou wilt find me, if ALLAH please, steadfast in my 
    faith.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
