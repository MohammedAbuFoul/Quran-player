    <TD>114. Said Jesus, son of Mary, `O ALLAH, our Lord, send down to us a 
      table from heaven spread with food that it may be to us a festival, to the 
      first of us and to the last of us and a Sign from THEE; and provide 
      sustenance for us, for THOU art the Best of Sustainers.' <BR>115. ALLAH 
      said, `Surely I will send it down to you; but whosoever of you disbelieves 
      afterwards - I will surely punish them with a punishment wherewith I will 
      not punish any other of the peoples.' <BR>116. And when ALLAH will say, `O 
      Jesus, son of Mary, didst thou say to men, `Take me and my mother for two 
      gods beside ALLAH ?' he will answer, `Holy art THOU, I could never say 
      that which I had no right. If I had said it, Thou wouldst have surely 
      known it. Thou knowest what is in my mind, and I know not what is in Thy 
      mind. It is Thou alone WHO art the Knower of all hidden things; <BR>117. 
      `I said nothing to them except that which Thou didst command me - Worship 
      ALLAH, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I 
      remained among them, but since Thou didst cause me to die, Thou, hast been 
      the Watcher over them, and Thou art Witness over all things; <BR>118. `If 
      Thou punish them, they are Thy servants; and if Thou forgive them, Thou 
      surely art the Mighty, the Wise. ' <BR>119. ALLAH will say, `This is a day 
      when only the truthful shall profit by their truthfulness. For them are 
      Gardens beneath which streams flow; therein shall they abide forever. 
      ALLAH is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with HIM; that 
      indeed is the supreme achievement.' <BR>120. To ALLAH belongs the Kingdom 
      of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them; and HE has power 
      over all things.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
