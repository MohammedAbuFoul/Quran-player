    <TD>15. And such of your women who are guilty of any flagrant impropriety 
      - call to witness four of you against them; and if they bear witness, then 
      confine them to the houses until death overtakes them or ALLAH opens for 
      them some other way. <BR>16. And if two from among you are guilty of it, 
      punish them both. And if they repent and amend, then leave them alone; 
      surely ALLAH is Oft-Returning with compassion and is ever Merciful. 
      <BR>17. Verily, ALLAH accepts the repentance of only those who do evil in 
      ignorance and then repent soon after. These are they to whom ALLAH turns 
      with mercy; and ALLAH is All-Knowing, Wise. <BR>18. There is no acceptance 
      of repentance for those who continue to do evil until, when death faces 
      one of them, he says, I do indeed repent now; nor for those who die 
      disbelievers. It is these for whom WE have prepared a painful punishment. 
      <BR>19. O ye who believe, it is not lawful for you to inherit women 
      against their will, nor should you detain them wrongfully that you may 
      take away part of that which you have given them, except that they be 
      guilty of a flagrant impropriety, and consort with them in kindness, and 
      if you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing wherein ALLAH has 
      placed much good.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
