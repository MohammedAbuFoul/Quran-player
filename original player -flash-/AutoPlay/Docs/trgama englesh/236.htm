    <TD>5. He said, `O my dear son, relate not thy dream to thy brothers, lest 
      they contrive a plot against thee, for Satan is to man an open enemy. 
      <BR>6. `And thus, as thou hast seen, thy Lord shall choose thee and teach 
      thee the interpretations of things divine and perfect HIS favour upon thee 
      and upon the family of Jacob as HE perfected it upon thy two forefathers - 
      Abraham and Isaac. Verily, thy Lord is All-Knowing, Wise.' <BR>7. Surely, 
      in Joseph and his brethren there are Signs for the inquirers; <BR>8. When 
      they said to each other, `Verily, Joseph and his brother are dearer to our 
      father than we are, although we are a strong party. Surely, our father is 
      in manifest error; <BR>9. So contrive to kill Joseph or cast him out to 
      some distant land, so that your father's favour may become exclusively 
      yours, and you can thereafter repent and become a righteous people.' 
      <BR>10. One of them said, `Kill not Joseph, but if you must do something, 
      cast him into the bottom of a deep well; some of the travelers will pick 
      him up. <BR>11. They said, `O our father, why dost thou not trust us with 
      respect to Joseph, when we are certainly his sincere well-wishers ? 
      <BR>12. `Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play, and 
      we shall surely keep guard over him.' <BR>13. He said, `It grieves me that 
      you should take him away, and I fear lest the wolf should devour him while 
      you are heedless of him.' <BR>14. They said, `Surely, if the wolf should 
      devour him while we are a strong party , then we shall indeed be great 
      losers.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
