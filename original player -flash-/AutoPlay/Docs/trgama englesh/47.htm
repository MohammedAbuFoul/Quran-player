    <TD>275. Those who devour interest do not rise except as rises one whom 
      Satan has smitten with insanity. That is because they say, `Trade also is 
      like interest;' whereas ALLAH has made trade lawful and has made interest 
      unlawful. So he to whom an admonition comes from his Lord and he desist, 
      then will that which he received in the pass be his; and his affair rests 
      with ALLAH. And those who revert to it they are the inmates of the Fire; 
      therein shall they abide. <BR>276. ALLAH will blot out interest and will 
      cause charity to increase. And ALLAH loves not anyone who is a confirmed 
      disbeliever and an arch-sinner. <BR>277. Surely, those, who believe and do 
      good deeds, and observe Prayer and pay the Zakat, shall have their reward 
      from their Lord, and no fear shall come on them, nor shall they grieve. 
      <BR>278. O ye who believe ! fear ALLAH and give up what remains of 
      interest, if you are truly believers. <BR>279. But if you do it not, then 
      beware of war from ALLAH and HIS Messenger; and if you repent, then you 
      shall have your principal; thus you shall not wrong nor shall you be 
      wronged.<BR>280. And if the debtor be in straitened circumstances, then 
      grant him respite till a time of ease. And that you remit it as charity 
      shall be better for you, if you only knew. <BR>281. And guard yourselves 
      against the day when you shall be made to return to ALLAH; then shall 
      every soul be paid in full what it has earned; and they shall not be 
      wronged.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
