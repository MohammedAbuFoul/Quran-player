    <TD>82. Those who belief and mix not up their belief with injustice - it 
      is they who shall have peace, and who are rightly guided. <BR>83. And that 
      is OUR argument which WE gave to Abraham against his people. WE exalt in 
      decrees of rank whomso WE please. Thy Lord is indeed Wise, All-Knowing. 
      <BR>84. And WE gave him Isaac and Jacob; each did WE guide aright, and 
      Noah did WE guide aright aforetime, and of his progeny, David and Solomon 
      and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus do WE reward those who do 
      good. <BR>85. And WE guided Zachariah and John and Jesus and Elias; each 
      one of them was of the righteous. <BR>86. And WE also guided Ishmael and 
      Elisha and Jonah and Lot ! and each one of them did WE exalt above the 
      people. <BR>87. And WE exalted some of their fathers and their children 
      and their brethren, and WE chose them and WE guided them in the straight 
      path. <BR>88. That is the guidance of ALLAH. HE guides thereby those of 
      HIS servants whom HE pleases. And if they had worshiped aught beside HIM, 
      surely all they did would have been of no avail to them. <BR>89. It is to 
      these whom WE gave the Book and dominion and Prophethood. But if they are 
      ungrateful for these favours it matters not, for WE have now entrusted 
      them to a people who are not ungrateful for them. <BR>90. These it is whom 
      ALLAH guide aright, so follow thou their guidance. Say, `I ask not of you 
      any reward for it. This is naught but an admonition for all 
    mankind.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
