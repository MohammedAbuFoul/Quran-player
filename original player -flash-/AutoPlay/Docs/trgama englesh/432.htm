    <TD>32. Those who were big with pride will say to those who were 
      considered weak, `Was it we that kept you away from the guidance, after it 
      had come to you ? Nay, it was you yourselves who were guilty.' <BR>33. And 
      those who were deemed weak will say to those who were proud, `Nay, but it 
      was your scheming night and day, when you bade us disbelieve in ALLAH and 
      set up equals with HIM.' And they will conceal their remorse when they see 
      the punishment; and WE shall put chains round the necks of those who 
      disbelieved. They will not be requited but for what they did. <BR>34. And 
      WE never sent a Warner to any city but the wealthy ones thereof said, 
      `Surely, we disbelieve in what you have been sent with.' <BR>35. And they 
      say, `We have more wealth and children; and we shall not be punished.' 
      <BR>36. Say, `Verily, my Lord enlarges the provision for whomsoever HE 
      pleases, and straitens it for whomsoever HE pleases; but most men do not 
      know.' <BR>37. And it is not your wealth, nor your children that will 
      bring you near US in rank but those, who believe and do good works, will 
      have a double reward for what they did. And in lofty mansions will they be 
      secure. <BR>38. And as to those who strive to frustrate the purpose of Our 
      Signs, it is they who will be brought to face punishment. <BR>39. Say, 
      `Surely, my Lord enlarges the provision for such of HIS servants as HE 
      pleases and straitens it for such of them as HE pleases. And whatever you 
      spend, HE will replace it; and HE is the Best of 
  providers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
