    <TD>1. Ha Mim. <BR>2. This Qur'an is a revelation from the Gracious, the 
      Merciful God, <BR>3. A Book, the verses of which have been expounded in 
      detail and which will be repeatedly read, couched in clear, eloquent 
      language, for a people who have knowledge, <BR>4. A bringer of glad 
      tidings and a warner. But most of them turn away and they hear not. <BR>5. 
      And they say, `Our hearts are secure under coverings against that which 
      thou callest us, and in our ears there is a heaviness, and between us and 
      thee is a veil. So carry on thy work; we, too, are working.' <BR>6. Say, 
      `I am only a mortal like you. It is revealed to me that your god is One 
      God; so go ye straight to HIM without deviating, and ask forgiveness of 
      HIM.' And woe to the idolaters, <BR>7. Who give not the Zakat, and they it 
      is who disbelieve in the Hereafter. <BR>8. As to those who believe and do 
      righteous deeds, for them, surely, is a reward that will never end. <BR>9. 
      Say, `Do you really disbelieve in HIM Who created the earth in two days ? 
      And do you set up equals to HIM ?' That is the Lord of the worlds. <BR>10. 
      HE placed therein firm mountains rising above its surface, and blessed it 
      with abundance, and provided therein its foods in proper measure in four 
      days - alike for all seekers. <BR>11. Then HE turned to the heaven, while 
      it was something like smoke, and said to it and to the earth; `Come ye 
      both of you in obedience, willingly or unwillingly.' They said, `We come 
      willingly.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
