    <TD>12. O ye who believe ! avoid much suspicion; for suspicion in some 
      cases is a sin. And spy not on one another, neither back-bite one another. 
      Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother ? Certainly, 
      you would loath it. And fear ALLAH, surely, ALLAH is oft-Returning with 
      compassion and is Merciful. <BR>13. O mankind, WE have created you from a 
      male and a female; And WE have made you tribes and sub-tribes that you may 
      know one another. Verily, the most honourable among you, in the sight of 
      ALLAH, is he who is the most righteous among you. Surely, ALLAH is 
      All-Knowing, All-Aware. <BR>14. The Arabs of the desert say, `We believe.' 
      Say, `You have not truly believed yet, but rather say, `We have submitted, 
      for true faith has not yet entered into your hearts.' But if you obey 
      ALLAH and HIS Messenger, HE will not detract anything from your deeds. 
      Surely, ALLAH is Most Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>15. The believers are only 
      those who truly believe in ALLAH and HIS Messenger, and then doubt not, 
      but strive with their possessions and their persons in the cause of ALLAH. 
      It is they who are truthful. <BR>16. Say, `Would you acquaint ALLAH with 
      your faith, while ALLAH knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is 
      in the earth, and ALLAH knows all things full well ?' <BR>17. They presume 
      to regard it a favour to thee that they have embraced Islam. Say, `Deem 
      not your embracing Islam as a favour unto me. On the contrary, ALLAH has 
      bestowed a favour upon you in that HE has guided you to the true Faith, if 
      you are truthful.' <BR>18. Verily, ALLAH knows the secrets of the heavens 
      and the earth. And ALLAH sees all what you 
do.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
