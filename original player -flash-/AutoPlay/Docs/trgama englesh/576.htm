    <TD>18. Lo ! he reflected and calculated ! <BR>19. Ruin seize him ! how he 
      calculated ! <BR>20. Ruin seize him again ! how he calculated ! <BR>21. 
      Then he looked around him, <BR>22. Then he frowned and scowled, <BR>23. 
      Then he turned away and was disdainful, <BR>24. And said, `This is nothing 
      but magic handed down; <BR>25. `This is nothing but the word of a man. 
      <BR>26. Soon shall I cast him into the fire of Hell. <BR>27. And what will 
      make thee know what Hell-fire is ? <BR>28. It spares not and it leaves 
      naught. <BR>29. It scorches the face. <BR>30. Over it are nineteen angels. 
      <BR>31. And none but angels have we made wardens of the Fire. And WE have 
      not fixed their number except as a trial for those who disbelieve, so that 
      those, who have been given the Book, may attain certainty and those who 
      believe may increase in faith, and those, who have been given the Book as 
      well as the believers, may not doubt, and that those in whose hearts is 
      disease and the disbelievers may say, `What does ALLAH mean by such an 
      illustration ?' Thus does ALLAH leave to go astray whom HE pleases and 
      guide whom HE pleases. And none knows the host of thy Lord but HE. And 
      this is nothing but a reminder for man. <BR>32. Nay, by the moon, <BR>33. 
      And by the night when it departs, <BR>34. And by the dawn when it shines 
      forth, <BR>35. Verily, it is one of the greatest calamities. <BR>36. A 
      warning to man, <BR>37. To him among you who wishes to advance in virtue 
      or hang back. <BR>38. Every soul is pledged for what it has earned; 
      <BR>39. Except those on the right hand. <BR>40. They will be in Gardens 
      enquiring <BR>41. From the guilty ones, <BR>42. `What has brought you into 
      Hell ?' <BR>43. They will say, `We were not of those who offered Prayer, 
      <BR>44. `Nor did we feed the poor, <BR>45. `And we indulged in idle talk 
      with those who indulge therein. <BR>46. `And we continued to deny the Day 
      of Judgment, <BR>47. `Until death overtook 
us.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
