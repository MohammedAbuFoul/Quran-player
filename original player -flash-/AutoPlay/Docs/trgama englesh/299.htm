    <TD>46. Wealth and children are ornaments of the life of this world. But 
      enduring good works are better in the sight of thy Lord in respect of 
      immediate reward, and better in respect of future hope. <BR>47. And 
      bethink of the day when WE shall remove the mountains and thou wilt see 
      the nations of the earth march forth against one another and WE shall 
      gather them all together and shall not leave any one of them behind. 
      <BR>48. And they will be presented to thy Lord standing in rows; and it 
      will be said to them, `Now have you come to US as WE created you at first. 
      But you thought that WE would not appoint a time for the fulfillment of 
      OUR promise to you.' <BR>49. And the Book of their deeds will be placed 
      before them, and thou wilt see the guilty ones fearful at what is therein; 
      and they will say, `O woe to us ! What kind of Book is this ! It leaves 
      out nothing small or great but has recorded it.' And they will find all 
      that they did confronting them, and thy Lord does not wrong anyone. 
      <BR>50. And call to mind the time when WE said to the angels, `Submit to 
      Adam,' and they all submitted but Iblis did not. HE was one of the jinn; 
      and he disobeyed the command of his Lord. Will you than take him and his 
      offspring for friends instead of ME while they are your enemies ? Evil is 
      the exchange for the wrongdoers. <BR>51. I did not make them witness the 
      creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their own creation; nor could I 
      take as helpers those who lead people astray. <BR>52. And remember the day 
      when HE will say to them, `Call those whom you deemed to be MY partners.' 
      Then will they call on them, but they will not answer them; and WE shall 
      place a barrier between them. <BR>53. And the guilty shall see the fire 
      and realize that they are going to fall therein; and they shall find no 
      escape therefrom.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
