    <TD>6. And they ask thee to hasten on the evil rather than the good, 
      whereas exemplary punishment have already come to pass before them. And, 
      verily, thy Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind despite their 
      wrongdoing, and verily, thy Lord is also Severe in retribution. <BR>7. And 
      those who disbelieve say, `Wherefore has not a Sign been sent down to him 
      from his Lord ?' Thou art surely a warner. And their is a Guide for every 
      people. <BR>8. ALLAH knows what every female bears, and what the wombs 
      render defective and discard and what they cause to grow. And with Him 
      everything has a proper measure. <BR>9. He is the Knower of the unseen and 
      the seen, the Incomparably Great, the Most High. <BR>10. He among you who 
      utters his word secretly, and he who utters it openly are equal in HIS 
      knowledge; and also he who hides by night and he who goes forth openly by 
      day. <BR>11. For him (the Messenger) is a succession of angels before him 
      and behind him; they guard him by the command of ALLAH. Surely, ALLAH 
      changes not the condition of a people until they change that which is in 
      their hearts. And when ALLAH decides to punish a people, there is no 
      repelling it, nor have they any helper besides HIM. <BR>12. HE it is Who 
      shows you the lightning to inspire fear and hope and HE raises the heavy 
      clouds. <BR>13. And the thunder glorifies HIM with HIS praise and likewise 
      do the angels for awe of HIM; and HE sends the thunderbolts, and smites 
      therewith whom HE wills, yet they dispute concerning ALLAH, while HE is 
      Severe in punishing.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
