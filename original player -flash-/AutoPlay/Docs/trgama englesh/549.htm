    <TD>1. O ye who believe ! take not MY enemy and your enemy for friends. 
      Would you offer them love, while they have disbelieved in the Truth which 
      has come to you and have driven out the Messenger and yourselves from your 
      homes, merely because you believe in ALLAH, your Lord ? When you go forth 
      to strive in MY cause and to seek MY pleasure, some of you send them 
      messages of love in secret, while I know best what you conceal and what 
      you reveal. And whoever of you does it has, indeed, strayed away from the 
      right path. <BR>2. If they get the upper hand of you, they will be your 
      active enemies, and will stretch forth their hands and their tongues 
      towards you to do you harm; and they ardently desire that you should 
      become disbelievers. <BR>3. Neither your ties of kindred, nor your 
      children will avail you aught on the Day of Resurrection. ALLAH will 
      decide between you. And ALLAH sees all what you do. <BR>4. Indeed there is 
      a good example for you in Abraham and those who were with him when they 
      said to their people, `We have nothing to do with you and with that which 
      you worship beside ALLAH. We disbelieve all that you believe in. There has 
      become manifest enmity and hatred between us and you for ever, until you 
      believe in ALLAH alone' - except that Abraham said to his father, `I will 
      surely ask forgiveness for thee, though I have no power to do aught for 
      thee against ALLAH.' Their prayer was: `Our Lord, in thee do we put our 
      trust and to thee do we turn in repentance, and towards thee is the final 
      return; <BR>5. `Our Lord, make us not a trial for those who disbelieve, 
      and forgive us, our Lord; for, Thou alone art Mighty, the 
  Wise.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
