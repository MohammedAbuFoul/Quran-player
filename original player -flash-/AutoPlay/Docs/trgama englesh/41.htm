    <TD>249. And when Talut set out with the forces, he said, `Surely, ALLAH 
      will try you with a river. So he who drinks therefrom is not of me; and he 
      who taste it not is assuredly of me, save him who takes only a handful of 
      water with his hand.' But they drank of it, except a few of them. And when 
      they crossed it - he and those who believed along with him - they said, 
      `We have no power today against Jalut and his forces.' But those who knew 
      for certain that they would one day meet ALLAH, said, `How many a small 
      party has triumphed over a large party by ALLAH's command ! And ALLAH is 
      with the steadfast.' <BR>250. And when they issued forth to encounter 
      Jalut and his forces, they said, `O our Lord, pour forth steadfastness 
      upon us, and make our steps firm, and help us against the disbelieving 
      people.' <BR>251. So they routed them by the command of ALLAH, and David 
      slew Jalut, and ALLAH gave him sovereignty and wisdom and taught him of 
      what HE pleased. And had not ALLAH repelled some men by others, the earth 
      would be full of mischief. But ALLAH is the Lord of grace to all peoples. 
      <BR>252. These are the Signs of ALLAH. WE recite them unto thee with 
      truth. Surely, thou art of the 
Messengers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
