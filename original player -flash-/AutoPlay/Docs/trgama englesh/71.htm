    <TD>158. And if you die or be slain, surely unto ALLAH shall you be 
      gathered together. <BR>159. And it is by the great mercy of ALLAH that 
      thou art kind towards them, and if thou hadst been rough and hard-hearted, 
      they would surely have dispersed from around thee. So pardon them and ask 
      forgiveness for them, and consult them in matters of administration; and 
      when thou art resolved, then put thy trust in ALLAH. Surely, ALLAH loves 
      those who put their trust in HIM. <BR>160. If ALLAH helps you none can 
      overcome you; but if HE forsakes you, then who is there that can help you 
      beside HIM ? In ALLAH, then, let the believers put their trust. <BR>161. 
      And it is not possible for a Prophet to act dishonestly, and whosoever 
      acts dishonestly shall bring with him that, concerning which he has been 
      dishonest, on the Day of Resurrection. Then every soul shall be fully paid 
      what it has earned; and they shall not be wronged. <BR>162. Is he who 
      follows the pleasure of ALLAH like him who draws on himself the wrath of 
      ALLAH and whose abode is Hell ? And an evil retreat it is ! <BR>163. They 
      have different ranks with ALLAH; and ALLAH sees what they do. <BR>164. 
      Verily, ALLAH has conferred a favour on the believers by raising among 
      them a Messenger from among themselves who recites to them HIS Signs, and 
      purifies them and teaches them the Book and Wisdom; and, before that, they 
      were surely in manifest error. <BR>165. What ! when a misfortune befalls 
      you - and you had already inflicted twice as much - you say, `Whence is 
      this ? Say, `It is from your ownselves.' Surely ALLAH has the power over 
      all things.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
