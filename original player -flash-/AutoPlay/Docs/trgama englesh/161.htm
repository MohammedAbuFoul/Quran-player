    <TD>82. And the only answer of his people was that they said, `Turn them 
      out of your town, for they are men who take pride in their purity.' 
      <BR>83. And WE saved him and his family except his wife; she was of those 
      who stayed behind. <BR>84. And WE rained upon them a rain. Now see, what 
      was the end of the sinners. <BR>85. And to Midian WE sent their brother 
      Shu'aib. He said, `O my people, worship ALLAH; you have no god other than 
      HIM. A clear Sign has indeed come to you from your Lord. So give full 
      measure and full weight and diminish not unto people their things and 
      create not disorder in the earth after it has been set in order. This is 
      better for you, if you are believers; <BR>86. `And sit not on every path, 
      threatening and turning away from the path of ALLAH those who believe in 
      HIM and seeking to make it crooked. And remember when you were few and HE 
      multiplied you. And behold, what was the end of those who created disorder 
      ! <BR>87. `And if there is a party among you, who believe in that with 
      which I have been sent, and a party who does not believe, then have 
      patience until ALLAH judges between us. And HE is the Best of 
    judges.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
