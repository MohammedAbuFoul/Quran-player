    <TD>44. And thou wast not on the Western side of the Mount when WE 
      committed the matter of Prophethood to Moses, nor wast thou among the 
      witnesses. <BR>45. But WE brought forth generations after Moses, and life 
      became prolonged for them. And thou wast not a dweller among the people of 
      Midian, rehearsing Our Signs unto them; But it is WE Who send Messengers. 
      <BR>46. And thou wast not on the side of the Mount with Moses, when WE 
      called to him and revealed to him Our prophecy concerning thee. But WE 
      have sent thee as a mercy from thy Lord, that thou mayest warn a people to 
      whom no warner had come before thee, that they may be mindful. <BR>47. And 
      were it not that if an affliction should befall them because of what their 
      hands have sent before them, they would say, `Our Lord, wherefore didst 
      Thou not send a Messenger to us that we might have followed Thy 
      commandments and been of the believers ?' We would not have sent thee as a 
      Messenger. <BR>48. But now when the truth has come to them from US, they 
      say, `Why has he not been given the like of what was given to Moses ?' Did 
      they not reject that which was given to Moses before ?' They said, `Aaron 
      and Moses are but two sorcerers who back up each other.' And they say, `We 
      reject the claim of both.' <BR>49. Say, `Then bring a Book from ALLAH 
      which is a better guide than these two books - the Torah and the Qur'an - 
      that I may follow it, if you are truthful.' <BR>50. But if they answer 
      thee not, then know that they only follow their own evil desires. And who 
      is more erring than he who follows his evil desires without any guidance 
      from ALLAH. Verily, ALLAH guides not the wrongdoing 
  people.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
