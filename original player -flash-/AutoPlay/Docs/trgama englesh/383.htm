    <TD>64. Or, Who originates creation, and then repeats it and Who provides 
      for you from the heaven and the earth ? Is there a god with ALLAH ? Say, 
      `Bring forward your proof if you are truthful.' <BR>65. Say, `None in the 
      heavens and the earth knows the unseen save ALLAH; and they do not know 
      when they will be raised up.' <BR>66. Nay, their knowledge respecting the 
      Hereafter has reached its limit, rather they are in doubt about it; rather 
      they are blind to it. <BR>67. And those who disbelieve say, `What ! when 
      we and our fathers have become dust, shall we indeed be brought forth 
      again ? <BR>68. `We were surely promised this before - we and our fathers; 
      this is nothing but tales of the ancients.' <BR>69. Say, `Travel in the 
      earth and see how evil was the end of the sinful.' <BR>70. And grieve thou 
      not for them nor be thou in distress because of what they devise. <BR>71. 
      And they say, `When will this promise be fulfilled, if you are truthful ?' 
      <BR>72. Say, `May be that a part of that which you would hasten on is 
      close behind you.' <BR>73. And, truly, thy Lord is gracious to mankind, 
      but most of them are not grateful. <BR>74. And surely thy Lord knows what 
      their bosoms conceal and what they disclose. <BR>75. And there is nothing 
      hidden in the heaven and the earth, but it is recorded in a clear Book. 
      <BR>76. Verily, this Qur'an explains to the Children of Israel most of 
      that concerning which they 
differ.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
