    <TD>182. But whoso apprehends from a testator a partiality or a wrong, and 
      makes peace between them (the parties affected), it shall be no sin for 
      him. Surely, ALLAH is most Forgiving and Merciful. <BR>183. O ye who 
      believe ! fasting is prescribed for you, as it was prescribed for those 
      before you, so that you may guard against evil.<BR>184. The prescribed 
      fasting is for a fixed number of days, but whoso among you is sick or on a 
      journey, shall fast the same number of other days; and for those who are 
      able to fast only with great difficulty, is an expiation - the feeding of 
      a poor man. And whoso does good of his own accord it is better for him. 
      And fasting is good for you, if you only knew. <BR>185. The month of 
      Ramadaan is that in which the Qur'an was revealed as a guidance for 
      mankind with clear proofs of guidance and discrimination. Therefore, 
      whosoever is present at home in this month let him fast therein. But whoso 
      is temporarily sick or on a journey, shall fast the same number of other 
      days, ALLAH desires ease for you and HE desires not hardship for you, and 
      HE desires that you may complete the number, and that you may exalt ALLAH 
      for HIS having guided you and that you may be grateful.<BR>186. And when 
      MY servants ask thee about ME, say `I am near. I answer the prayer of the 
      supplicant when he prays to ME. So they should hearken to ME and believe 
      in ME that they may follow the right 
way.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
