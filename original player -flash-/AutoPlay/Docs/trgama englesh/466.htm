    <TD>68. And the trumpet will be blown, and all who are in the heavens and 
      all who are in the earth will fall down in a swoon, except those whom 
      ALLAH will be pleased to spare. Then it will be blown a second time, and 
      lo ! they will be standing, awaiting judgment. <BR>69. And the earth will 
      shine with the light of her Lord, and the Book will be laid open before 
      them, and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought, and judgment 
      will be given between them with justice, and they will not be wronged. 
      <BR>70. And every soul will be fully rewarded for what it did. And HE 
      knows well what they do. <BR>71. And those who disbelieve will be driven 
      to Hell in troops until, when they arrive there, its gates will be opened, 
      and its Keepers will say to them, `Did not the Messengers from among 
      yourselves come to you, reciting unto you the Signs of your Lord, and 
      warning you of the meeting of this day of yours ?' They will say, `Yea, 
      but the word of the punishment was bound to be fulfilled in respect of the 
      disbelievers.' <BR>72. It will be said, `Enter ye the gates of Hell, 
      abiding therein. And evil is the abode of the arrogant.' <BR>73. And 
      those, who feared their Lord, will be conducted to Heaven in groups until 
      when they arrive there, its gates will be opened and its Keepers will say 
      to them, `Peace be upon you ! be ye happy, and enter it, abiding therein.' 
      <BR>74. And they will say, `All praise belongs to ALLAH Who has made good 
      to us HIS promise, and has given us the earth to inherit, we shall make 
      our abode in the Garden wherever we please.' How excellent is the reward 
      of the righteous workers !&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
