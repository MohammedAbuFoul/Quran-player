    <TD>125. So, whomsoever ALLAH intends to guide, HE expands his bosom for 
      the acceptance of Islam; and whomsoever HE intends that he should go 
      astray, HE makes his bosom narrow and close, as though he was mounting up 
      into the skies. Thus does ALLAH inflict punishment on those who do not 
      believe. <BR>126. And this is the path of thy Lord leading straight to 
      HIM. WE have, indeed, explained the Signs in detail for a people who would 
      be admonished. <BR>127. For them is the abode of peace with their Lord, 
      and HE is their Friend because of their works. <BR>128. And on the day 
      when HE will gather them all together, HE will say, `O company of jinn ! 
      you won over to yourselves a great many from among men.' And their friends 
      from among men will say, `Our Lord ! we profited from one another, but now 
      we have reached our term which Thou didst appoint for us.' HE will say, 
      `The Fire is your abode, wherein you shall abide, save what ALLAH may 
      will.' Surely, Thy Lord is Wise, All-Knowing. <BR>129. And thus do WE make 
      some of the wrongdoers friends of each other because of what they earn. 
      <BR>130. 'O company of jinn and men ! Did not Messengers come to you from 
      among yourselves who related to you MY Signs and who warned you of the 
      meeting of this your day ?' They will say, `We bear witness against 
      ourselves.' And the worldly life deceived them. And they will bear witness 
      against themselves that they were disbelievers. <BR>131. The Messengers 
      are sent because thy Lord would not destroy the towns unjustly while their 
      people were unwarned.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
