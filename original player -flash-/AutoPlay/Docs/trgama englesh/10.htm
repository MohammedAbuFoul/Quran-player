    <TD>62. Surely, those who believe and the Jews and the Christians and the 
      Sabians - whichever party from among these truly believes in ALLAH and the 
      Last Day and does good deeds, shall have their reward with their Lord, and 
      no fear shall come upon then nor shall they grieve. <BR>63. And remember 
      the time when WE took a covenant from you and raised you above the Mount, 
      saying, `Hold fast that which WE have given you and bear in mind what is 
      therein, that you may be saved.' <BR>64. Then you turned back thereafter; 
      and had it not been for ALLAH's grace and HIS mercy upon you, you would 
      surely have been of the losers.<BR>65. And surely, you have known the end 
      of those amongst you, who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath. So WE 
      said to them, `Be ye apes, despised.' <BR>66. Thus WE made it an example 
      to those of its time and to those who came after it, and a lesson to those 
      who fear God. <BR>67. And remember when Moses said to his people, `ALLAH 
      commands you to slaughter a cow,' they said, `Dost thou make a jest of us 
      ?' He said `I seek refuge with ALLAH least I should be of the ignorant.' 
      <BR>68. They said, `Pray for us to thy Lord that HE make plain to us what 
      she is,' He answered, `God says, it is a cow, neither old nor young, 
      full-grown between the two; now do what you are commanded.' <BR>69. They 
      said, `Pray for us to thy Lord that HE make plain to us of what colour she 
      is.' He answered, `God says, it is a cow of dun colour, pure and rich in 
      tone, delighting the 
beholders.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
