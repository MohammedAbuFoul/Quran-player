    <TD>8. Their reward is with their Lord - Gardens of Eternity, through 
      which streams flow; they will abide therein for ever. ALLAH is 
      well-pleased with them and they are well-pleased with HIM. That is for him 
      who fears his Lord. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. When the earth is shaken with her violent shaking, <BR>2. And the earth 
      throws up her burdens, <BR>3. And man says, `What is the matter with her 
      ?' <BR>4. On that day will she tell her news, <BR>5. For, thy Lord will 
      have commanded her. <BR>6. On that day will men issue forth in scattered 
      groups that they may be shown the results of their works. <BR>7. Then 
      whoso does an atom's weight of good will see it, <BR>8. And whoso does an 
      atom's weight of evil will also see it, <BR>&nbsp;

      hoofs, <BR>3. Making raids at dawn, <BR>4. And raising clouds of dust 
      thereby, <BR>5. And thus penetrate into the centre of the enemy ranks. 
      <BR>6. Surely, man is ungrateful to his Lord. <BR>7. And, surely, he bears 
      witness to it by his conduct. <BR>8. And, surely, he is passionate in his 
      love for wealth. <BR>9. Does not such a one know that when those in the 
      graves are raised,&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
