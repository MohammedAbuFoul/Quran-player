    <TD>103. And when they both submitted to the will of God, and Abraham had 
      thrown him down on his forehead, <BR>104. WE called to him, `O Abraham, 
      <BR>105. `Thou hast, indeed, fulfilled the dream.' Thus, indeed, do WE 
      reward those who do good. <BR>106. That, surely, was a manifest trial. 
      <BR>107. And WE ransomed him with a mighty sacrifice. <BR>108. And WE left 
      for him a good name among the succeeding generations. <BR>109. Peace be 
      upon Abraham ! <BR>110. Thus do WE reward those who do good. <BR>111. 
      Surely, he was one of our believing servants. <BR>112. And WE gave him the 
      glad tidings of Isaac, a Prophet, and one of the righteous. <BR>113. And 
      WE bestowed blessings on him and on Isaac. And among their progeny are 
      some who do good and others who clearly wrong themselves. <BR>114. And, 
      indeed, WE bestowed favours on Moses and Aaron. <BR>115. And WE saved them 
      both and their people from the great distress; <BR>116. And WE helped 
      them, and it was they who were victorious. <BR>117. And WE gave them the 
      Book that made everything clear; <BR>118. And WE guided them to the right 
      path. <BR>119. And WE left for them a good name among the succeeding 
      generations. - <BR>120. Peace be on Moses and Aaron ! <BR>121. Thus, 
      indeed, do WE reward those who do good. <BR>122. Surely, they were both 
      among Our believing servants. <BR>123. And, assuredly, Elias also was one 
      of the Messengers, <BR>124. When he said to his people, `Will you not be 
      God-fearing ? <BR>125. `Do you call on Ba`l and forsake the Best of 
      creators - <BR>126. ALLAH, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers of 
      old ?'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
