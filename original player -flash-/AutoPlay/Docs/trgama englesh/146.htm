    <TD>138. And they say, `Such and such cattle and crops are forbidden. None 
      shall eat thereof save whom we please' - so they assert - and there are 
      cattle whose backs are forbidden, and there are cattle over which they 
      pronounce not the name of ALLAH, forging a lie against HIM. Soon will HE 
      requite them for that which they have fabricated. <BR>139. And they say, 
      `That which is in the wombs of such and such cattle is reserved for our 
      males and is forbidden to our wives;' but if it be born dead, then they 
      all partake thereof. HE will reward them for their assertion. Surely, HE 
      is Wise, All-Knowing. <BR>140. Losers indeed are they who slay their 
      children foolishly for lack of knowledge, and make unlawful what ALLAH has 
      provided for them, forging a lie against ALLAH. They have indeed gone 
      astray and are not rightly guided. <BR>141. And HE it is Who produces 
      gardens, trellised and untrellised, and the date-palm and the corn-fields 
      whose fruits vary in taste, and the olive and the pomegranate, similar and 
      dissimilar. Eat of the fruit thereof when they bear fruit, and pay HIS due 
      on the day of the harvest and exceed not the bounds. Surely, ALLAH loves 
      not those who exceed the bounds. <BR>142. And of the cattle HE has created 
      some for burden and some for slaughter. Eat of that which ALLAH has 
      provided for you, and follow not in the footsteps of Satan. Surely he is 
      to you an open foe.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
