    <TD>26. And remember when you were a few and deemed weak in the land, and 
      were in fear lest people should snatch you away, but HE sheltered you and 
      strengthened you with HIS help, and provided you with good things that you 
      might be thankful. <BR>27. O ye who believe ! prove not false to ALLAH and 
      the Messenger, nor betray your trusts knowingly. <BR>28. And know that 
      your possessions and your children are but a trial and that it is ALLAH 
      with Whom is a great reward. <BR>29. O ye who believe ! if you do your 
      duty to ALLAH, HE will grant you a distinction and will remove your evils 
      from you and will forgive you; and ALLAH is the Lord of great bounty. 
      <BR>30. And remember when the disbelievers devised plans against thee that 
      they might put thee in confinement or slay thee or expel thee. And they 
      planned and ALLAH also planned, and ALLAH is the Best of planners. <BR>31. 
      And when OUR verses are recited to them, they say, `We have heard. If we 
      wished we could certainly say the like of it. This is nothing but mere 
      tales of the ancients' <BR>32. And remember the time when they said, `O 
      ALLAH, if this be indeed the truth from Thee, then rain down upon us 
      stones from heaven or bring down upon us a grievous punishment.' <BR>33. 
      But ALLAH would not punish them while thou wast among them, and ALLAH 
      would not punish them while they sought 
forgiveness.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
