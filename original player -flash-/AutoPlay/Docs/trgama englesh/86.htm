    <TD>45. And ALLAH knows your enemies well. And sufficient is ALLAH as a 
      Friend, and sufficient is ALLAH as a helper. <BR>46. There were some among 
      the Jews who pervert words from their proper places . And they say, `We 
      hear and we disobey' and `hear us and may God's Word never be heard by 
      you,' and they say, `Ra'ina.' They say all this twisting with their 
      tongues and seeking to injure the Faith. And if they had said, `We hear 
      and we obey,' and hear thou,' and `Unzurna,' it would have been better for 
      them and more upright. But ALLAH has cursed them for their disbelief; so 
      they believe but little. <BR>47. O ye people of the Book ! believe in what 
      WE have now sent down, fulfilling that which is with you, before WE 
      destroy some of your leaders and turn them on their backs or curse them as 
      WE cursed the people of the Sabbath. And the decree of ALLAH is bound to 
      be fulfilled. <BR>48. Surely, ALLAH will not forgive that a partner be 
      associated with HIM; but HE will forgive whatever is short of that to 
      whomsoever HE pleases. And whoso associates partners with ALLAH has indeed 
      devised a very great sin. <BR>49. Hast thou not seen those who hold 
      themselves to be pure ? Nay, it is ALLAH who purifies whomsoever HE 
      pleases, and they will not be wronged a whit. <BR>50. See how they forge a 
      lie against ALLAH ! And sufficient is that as a manifest sin. <BR>51. Hast 
      thou not seen those who were given a portion of the Book ? They believe in 
      evil objects and follow those who transgress, and they say of the 
      disbelievers, `These are better guided in religion than those who 
      believe.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
