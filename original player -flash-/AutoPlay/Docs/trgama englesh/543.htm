    <TD>7. Seest thou not that ALLAH knows all that is in the heavens and all 
      that is in the earth ? There is no secret counsel of three, but HE is 
      their fourth, nor of five but HE is their sixth, nor of less than that, 
      nor of more, but HE is with them wheresoever they may be. Then on the Day 
      of Resurrection HE will inform them of what they did. Surely, ALLAH has 
      full knowledge of all things. <BR>8. Seest thou not those who were 
      forbidden to hold secret counsels, then they return to that which they 
      were forbidden, and confer in secret for sin and transgression and 
      disobedience to the Messenger ? And when they come to thee, they greet 
      thee with agreeting with which ALLAH, has not greeted thee; but among 
      themselves they say, `Why does not ALLAH punish us for what we say ?' 
      Sufficient for them is Hell, wherein they will burn; and a most evil 
      destination it is ! <BR>9. O ye who believe ! When you confer together in 
      private, confer not for the purpose of promoting sin and transgression and 
      disobedience to the Messenger, but confer for the purpose of promoting 
      virtue and righteousness, and fear ALLAH unto Whom you shall all be 
      gathered. <BR>10. Holding of secret counsels for evil purposes is only of 
      Satan, that he may cause grief to those who believe; but it cannot harm 
      them in the least, except by ALLAH's leave. And in ALLAH should the 
      believers put their trust. <BR>11. O ye who believe ! when it is said to 
      you, `Make room in your assemblies,' then do make room. ALLAH will make 
      ample room for you. And when it is said, `Rise up' then rise up; ALLAH 
      will raise those who believe from among you, and those whom knowledge is 
      given to degrees of rank. And ALLAH is Well-Aware of what you 
  do.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
