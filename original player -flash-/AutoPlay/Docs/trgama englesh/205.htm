    <TD>112. Those who turn to ALLAH in repentance, who worship HIM, who 
      praise HIM, who go about in the land serving HIM, who bow down to HIM, who 
      prostrate themselves in Prayer, who enjoin good and forbid evil, and who 
      observe the limits set by ALLAH. And give glad tidings to those who 
      believe. <BR>113. It does not behove the Prophet and those who believe 
      that they should ask of ALLAH forgiveness for the idolaters, even though 
      they may be their kinsmen, after it has become plain to them that they are 
      the companions of Hell. <BR>114. And Abraham asking forgiveness for his 
      father was only because of a promise he has made to him, but when it 
      became clear to him that he was an enemy of ALLAH, he dissociated himself 
      from him. Surely, Abraham was most tender-hearted and forbearing. <BR>115. 
      And ALLAH would not cause a people to go astray after HE has guided them, 
      until HE makes clear to them that which they ought to guard against. 
      Surely, ALLAH knows all things well. <BR>116. Surely, it is ALLAH to Whom 
      belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. HE gives life and causes 
      death. And you have no friend nor helper besides ALLAH. <BR>117. ALLAH has 
      certainly turned with mercy to the Prophet and to the Emigrants and the 
      Helpers who followed him in the hour of distress after the hearts of a 
      party of them had almost swerved from duty. HE again turned to them with 
      mercy. Surely, HE is to them Compassionate, 
Merciful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
