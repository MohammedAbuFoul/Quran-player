    <TD>29. `Those who believe and do good works - happiness is decreed for 
      them, and an excellent place of return. <BR>30. Thus have WE sent thee to 
      a people, before whom other peoples have passed away, that thou mayest 
      recite to them what WE have revealed to thee, for they deny the Gracious 
      God. Say, `HE is my Lord; There is no god but HE. In HIM do I put my trust 
      and towards HIM is my return. <BR>31. And if there was a Qur'an by which 
      mountains could be moved or by which the earth could be cut asunder or by 
      which the dead could be spoken to, they would still not believe in it. 
      Nay, the matter of their believing rests entirely with ALLAH. Have not the 
      believers yet come to know that if ALLAH had enforced HIS will HE could 
      have surely guided all mankind ? And as for those who disbelieve, disaster 
      shall not cease to befall them for what they have wrought or to alight 
      near their home, until the promise of ALLAH comes to pass. Surely, ALLAH 
      fails not in HIS promise. <BR>32. And surely, Messengers were mocked at 
      before thee; but I granted respite to those who disbelieved. Then I seized 
      them and how terrible was My punishment ! <BR>33. Will then HE, Who stands 
      over every soul watching what it earns, let them go unpunished ? Yet they 
      ascribe partners to ALLAH. Say, `Do name them.' Would you inform HIM of 
      what HE does not know in the earth ? Or, is it a mere empty saying ? Nay, 
      but the design of the disbelievers has been made to appear beautiful in 
      their eyes, and they have been kept back from the right way. And he whom 
      ALLAH lets go astray shall have no guide. <BR>34. For them is a punishment 
      in the present life; and surely, the punishment in the Hereafter is 
      harder, and they will have no defender against 
ALLAH.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
