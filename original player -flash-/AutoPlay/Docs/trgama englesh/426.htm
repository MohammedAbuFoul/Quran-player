    <TD>55. There is no blame on them in this respect with regard to their 
      fathers or their sons or their brothers, or the sons of their brothers, or 
      the sons of their sisters, or their womenfolk or those whom their right 
      hands possess. And fear ALLAH, O wives of the Prophet. Verily, ALLAH is a 
      Witness over all things. <BR>56. ALLAH sends down HIS blessings on the 
      Prophet and HIS angels pray for him. O ye who believe, you too should 
      invoke HIS blessings on him and salute him with the salutation of peace. 
      <BR>57. Verily, those who malign ALLAH and HIS Messenger - ALLAH has 
      cursed them in this world and in the Hereafter, and has prepared for them 
      an abasing punishment. <BR>58. And those, who malign believing men and 
      believing women for what they have not earned, shall bear the guilt of a 
      calumny and a manifest sin. <BR>59. O Prophet ! tell thy wives and thy 
      daughters, and the women of the believers, that they should pull down upon 
      them of their outer cloaks from their heads over their faces. That is more 
      likely that they may thus be recognized and not molested. And ALLAH is 
      Most Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>60. If the Hypocrites and those in whose 
      hearts is a disease and those who cause agitation in the City by spreading 
      false rumours, desist not, WE shall, surely, urge thee on against them; 
      then they will not dwell therein as thy neighbours save for a little 
      while. <BR>61. They are accursed. Wherever they are found they will be 
      seized, and cut into pieces. <BR>62. Such has been the way of ALLAH with 
      those who passed away before, and never thou wilt find a change in the way 
      of ALLAH.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
