    <TD>7. Those who hope not for the meeting with Us and are pleased and 
      satisfied with the life of this world and those who are heedless of Our 
      Signs - <BR>8. It is these whose abode is Fire, because of what they 
      earned. <BR>9. As for those who believe and do good works - their Lord 
      shall guide them along the path of success because of their faith. Streams 
      shall flow beneath them in the Gardens of bliss. <BR>10. Their prayer 
      therein shall be, `Glory be to Thee, O ALLAH ! and their greeting therein 
      to each other shall be, `Peace ! And the end of their prayer shall be, 
      `All praise be to ALLAH, the Lord of all the worlds.' <BR>11. And if ALLAH 
      were to hasten for men the ill consequences of their actions as they would 
      seek to hasten on good, the end of their term of life would have been 
      already brought upon them. But We leave those who look not for the meeting 
      with Us to wonder distractedly in their transgression. <BR>12. And when 
      trouble befalls a man, he calls on Us, lying on his side, or sitting or 
      standing, but when We have removed his trouble from him, he goes his way 
      as though he had never called on Us for the removal of the trouble that 
      befell him. Thus it is that the doings of the extravagant are made to seem 
      fair in their eyes. <BR>13. And We destroyed many generations before you 
      when they did wrong; and there came to them Messengers with clear Signs, 
      but they would not believe. Thus do We requite the guilty people. <BR>14. 
      Then, We made you their successors in the earth after them that We might 
      see how you would act.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
