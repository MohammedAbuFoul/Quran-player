    <TD>47. To HIM alone is referred the knowledge of the Hour. And no fruits 
      come forth from their spathes, nor does any female bear a child, nor does 
      she give birth to it, but with HIS knowledge. And on the day when HE will 
      call unto them, saying, `Where are MY partners ?' They will say, `We 
      declare unto Thee, not one of us is a witness thereto.' <BR>48. And all 
      that they used to call upon before will be lost to them, and they will 
      know for certain that they have no place of escape. <BR>49. Man tires not 
      of praying for good; but if evil touch him, he despairs, giving up all 
      hope. <BR>50. And if WE make him taste of mercy from US after some 
      affliction that has befallen him, he is sure to say, `This is but my due 
      and I do not think the Hour will ever come. But even if I am returned to 
      my Lord, I will, surely, have with HIM the very best.' Then WE will, 
      surely, inform the disbelievers of all that they did, and WE will, 
      certainly, make them taste a hard punishment. <BR>51. And when WE bestow a 
      favour on man, he goes away, turning aside; but when evil touches him, lo 
      ! he starts offering long prayers. <BR>52. Say, `Tell me, if it is from 
      ALLAH, but you disbelieve in it - who is more astray than one who has 
      drifted far away from the truth ? <BR>53. Soon WE will show them Our Signs 
      in farthest regions of the earth and among their own people until it 
      becomes manifest to them that it is the truth. It is not enough that thy 
      Lord is Witness over all things ? <BR>54. Aye, they are, surely, in doubt 
      concerning the meeting with their Lord; aye, HE, certainly, encompasses 
      all things.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
