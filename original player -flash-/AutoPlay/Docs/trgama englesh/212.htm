    <TD>26. For those who do good deeds, there shall be the best reward and 
      yet more blessings. And neither darkness nor ignominy shall cover their 
      faces. It is these who are the inmates of Heaven; therein shall they 
      abide. <BR>27. And as for those who do evil deeds, the punishment of an 
      evil deed shall be the like thereof, and ignominy shall cover them. They 
      shall have none to protect them from ALLAH. And they shall look as if 
      their faces had been covered with dark patches of night. It is these who 
      are the inmates of the Fire; therein shall they abide. <BR>28. And 
      remember the day when WE shall gather them all together, then shall WE say 
      to those who associated gods with US, `Stand back in your places, you and 
      your associated gods.' Then WE shall separate them widely from one 
      another, and their associated gods will say, `Surely, it was not us that 
      you worshiped; <BR>29. `So ALLAH is now sufficient as a Witness between us 
      and you. We were certainly unaware of your worship.' <BR>30. There shall 
      every soul realize what it shall have sent on before. And they shall be 
      brought back to ALLAH, their True Master, and all that they used to forge 
      shall be lost to them. <BR>31. Say, `Who provides sustenance for you from 
      the heaven or the earth ? Or who is it that has power over the ears and 
      the eyes ? And who brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth 
      the dead from the living ? And who regulates all affairs ? They will say, 
      `ALLAH.' Then say, `Will you not seek HIS protection ?' <BR>32. Such is 
      ALLAH, your True Lord. So what is there other than the truth but error ? 
      How then are you being turned away from the truth ? <BR>33. Thus is the 
      word of thy Lord proved true against those who rebel, that they believe 
      not.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
