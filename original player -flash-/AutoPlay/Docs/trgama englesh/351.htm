    <TD>11. Verily, those who invented the great lie are a party from among 
      you. Think not that this incident is an evil for you, nay, it is good for 
      you. Every one of them shall have his share of what he has earned of the 
      sin; and he among them who took the principal part therein shall have a 
      grievous punishment. <BR>12. When you heard of it, why did not the 
      believing men and believing women think well of their own people and say, 
      `This is a manifest lie ?' <BR>13. Why did not those, who gave currency to 
      this charge, bring four witnesses to prove it ? Since they have not 
      brought the required witnesses, they are indeed liars in the sight of 
      ALLAH. <BR>14. Were it not for the grace of ALLAH and HIS mercy upon you, 
      in this world and the Hereafter, a great punishment would have befallen 
      you on account of the slander you plunged in; <BR>15. For, you began to 
      learn it from each other's tongue and then you uttered with your mouths 
      that of which you had no knowledge, and you thought it to be a light 
      matter, while in the sight of ALLAH it was a grievous thing. <BR>16. And 
      wherefore did you not say, when you heard of it, `It is not proper for us 
      to talk about it. Holy art Thou, O God, this is a grievous calumny.' 
      <BR>17. ALLAH admonishes you that you never repeat the like thereof, if 
      you are believers. <BR>18. And ALLAH explains to you the commandments; and 
      ALLAH is All-Knowing, Wise. <BR>19. Those, who love that indecency should 
      spread among the believers, will have a painful punishment in this world 
      and the Hereafter. And ALLAH knows and you know not. <BR>20. And but for 
      the grace of ALLAH and HIS mercy upon you and that ALLAH is Compassionate 
      and Merciful, you would have been 
ruined.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
