    <TD>23. They said, `Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves and if Thou 
      forgive us not and have not mercy on us, we shall surely be of the 
      losers.' <BR>24. God said, `Go forth, some of you will be enemies of 
      others. And for you there is an abode on the earth and a provision for a 
      time.' <BR>25. HE said, `Therein shall you live and therein shall you die 
      and therefrom shall you be brought forth.' <BR>26. O children of Adam, WE 
      have indeed send down to you raiment to cover you nakedness and to be a 
      means of adornment; but the raiment of righteousness - that is the best. 
      That is of the commandments of ALLAH, that they may remember. <BR>27. O 
      children of Adam, let not Satan seduce you, even as he turned your parents 
      out of the Garden, stripping them of their raiment that he might show them 
      their nakedness. Truly, he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you see 
      them not. Surely, WE have made Satan friends of those who believe not. 
      <BR>28. And when they commit an indecency, they say, `We found our fathers 
      doing it and ALLAH has enjoined it upon us.' Say, `ALLAH never enjoins 
      indecencies. Do you say of ALLAH that which you know not ?' <BR>29. Say, 
      `My Lord has enjoined justice. And fix your attention aright at everytime 
      and place of worship and call upon HIM, making yourselves sincere towards 
      HIM in religion. As HE brought you into being, so shall you return to 
      HIM.' <BR>30. Some has HE guided and for some error has become their 
      desert. They have taken evil ones for friends instead of ALLAH and they 
      think that they are rightly 
guided.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
