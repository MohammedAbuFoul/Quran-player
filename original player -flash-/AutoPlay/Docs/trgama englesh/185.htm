    <TD>62. And if they seek to deceive thee, then surely ALLAH is sufficient 
      for thee. HE it is Who has strengthened thee with HIS help and with the 
      believers; <BR>63. And HE has put affection between their hearts. If thou 
      hadst expended all that is in the earth, thou couldst not have put 
      affection between their hearts, but ALLAH has put affection between them. 
      Surely, HE is Mighty, Wise. <BR>64. O Prophet, ALLAH is Sufficient for 
      thee and those who follow thee of the believers. <BR>65. O Prophet, urge 
      the believers to fight. If there be of you twenty who are steadfast, they 
      shall overcome two hundred; And if there be a hundred of you, they shall 
      overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve, because they are a people do 
      not understand. <BR>66. For the present ALLAH has lighten your burden, for 
      HE knows that there is weakness in you. So, if there be a hundred of you 
      who are steadfast, they shall overcome two hundred; and if there be a 
      thousand of you, they shall overcome two thousand by the command of ALLAH. 
      And ALLAH is with those who are steadfast. <BR>67. It does not behove a 
      Prophet that he should have captives until he engages in regular fighting 
      in the land. If you take captives, except in regular fighting, you will be 
      regarded as desiring the goods of this world, while ALLAH desires for you 
      the Hereafter. And ALLAH is Mighty, Wise. <BR>68. Had there not been a 
      decree from ALLAH which had gone before, great distress would have surely 
      overtaken you in consequence of what you took. <BR>69. So eat, of that 
      which you have won in war as lawful and good, and fear ALLAH. Surely, 
      ALLAH is Most Forgiving, 
Merciful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
