    <TD>23. And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him against his 
      will. And she bolted the doors, and said, `Now come.' He said, `I seek 
      refuge with ALLAH. HE is my Lord. HE has made my stay with you honourable. 
      Verily, the wrongdoers never prosper.' <BR>24. And she made up her mind 
      with regard to him, to seduce him, and he made up his mind with regard to 
      her, to resist her. If he had not seen manifest Sign of his Lord, he could 
      not have shown such determination. Thus did it come about that WE might 
      turn away from him all evil and indecency. Surely, he was one of Our 
      chosen servants. <BR>25. And they both raced to the door, and in the 
      struggle she tore his shirt from behind, and they found her lord at the 
      door. She said to him, `What shall be the punishment of one who intended 
      evil to thy wife, save imprisonment or a grievous chastisement ?' <BR>26. 
      Joseph said, `She it was who sought to seduce me against my will.' And a 
      witness of her household bore witness saying, `If his shirt is torn from 
      the front, then she has spoken the truth and he is a liar; <BR>27. `But if 
      his shirt is torn from behind, then she has lied and he is of the 
      truthful'. <BR>28. So when he saw his shirt torn from behind, he said, 
      Surely, this is a device of you women. Your device is indeed mighty; 
      <BR>29. `O Joseph, do thou overlook this mischief and thou, O woman, ask 
      forgiveness for thy sin. Certainly thou art of the guilty.' <BR>30. And 
      the women in the city said, `The wife of Aziz seek to seduce her slave-boy 
      against his will. He has infatuated her with love. Indeed we see her in 
      manifest error.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
