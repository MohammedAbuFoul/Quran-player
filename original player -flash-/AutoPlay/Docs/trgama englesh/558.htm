    <TD>1. O Prophet ! when you divorce women, divorce them for the prescribed 
      period, and thereafter reckon the period; and fear ALLAH, your Lord. Turn 
      them not out of their houses, nor should they themselves leave unless they 
      commit manifest indecency. These are the limits set by ALLAH; and whoso 
      transgresses the limits of ALLAH, he, indeed, wrongs his own soul. Thou 
      knowest not; it may be that thereafter ALLAH will bring something new to 
      pass. <BR>2. Then, when they are about to reach the limit of their 
      prescribed term, retain them with kindness, or part with them in a 
      suitable manner, and call to witness two just persons from among you; and 
      bear true witness for ALLAH. Thus is admonished he who believes in ALLAH 
      and the Last Day. And he who fears ALLAH - HE will make for him a way out; 
      <BR>3. And will provide for him from whence he expects not. And he who 
      puts his trust in ALLAH - HE is sufficient for him. Verily, ALLAH will 
      accomplish HIS purpose. For everything has ALLAH appointed a measure. 
      <BR>4. And if you are in doubt as to the prescribed period for such of 
      your women as have despaired of monthly courses, then know that the 
      prescribed period for them is three months, and also for such as do not 
      have their monthly courses yet. And as for those who are with child, their 
      period shall be until they are delivered of their burden. And whoso fears 
      ALLAH, HE will provide facilities for him in his affair. <BR>5. That is 
      the command of ALLAH which HE has sent down to you. And whoso fears ALLAH 
      - HE will remove the evil effects of his deeds and will enlarge his 
      reward.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
