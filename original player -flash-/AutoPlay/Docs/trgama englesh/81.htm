    <TD>20. And if you desire to take one wife in place of another and you 
      have given one of them a treasure, take not aught therefrom. Will you take 
      it by false accusations and manifest sinfulness ? <BR>21. And how can you 
      take it when one of you may have consorted with the other, and they (the 
      women) have taken from you a strong covenant ? <BR>22. And marry not those 
      women whom your fathers married, except what has already passed. It is a 
      thing foul and hateful and an evil way. <BR>23. Forbidden to you are your 
      mothers, and your daughters, and your sisters, and your fathers' sisters 
      and your mothers' sisters and brother's daughters, and sister's daughters, 
      and your foster mothers that have given you suck, and your foster-sisters, 
      and the mothers of your wives, and your step-daughters, who are your wards 
      being born of your wives to whom you have gone in - but if you have not 
      gone in unto them, there is no blame on you - and the wives of your sons 
      that are from your loins; and it is forbidden to you to have two sisters 
      together in marriage, except what has already passed; surely ALLAH is Most 
      Forgiving 
Merciful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
