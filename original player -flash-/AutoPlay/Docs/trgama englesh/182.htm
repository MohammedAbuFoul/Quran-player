    <TD>41. And know that whatever you take as spoils in war, a fifth thereof 
      is for ALLAH and for the Messenger and the kindred and the orphans and the 
      needy and the wayfarer, if you believe in ALLAH and what WE sent down to 
      Our servant on the Day of Distinction, - the day when the two armies met - 
      and ALLAH has power to do all that HE wills.<BR>42. When you were on the 
      nearer bank of the Valley, and they were on the further bank, and the 
      caravan was below you. And if you had to make an appointment between you, 
      you would have certainly differed with regard to the time of the 
      appointment. But the encounter was brought about without appointment that 
      ALLAH might accomplish the thing that was decreed, so that he, who had 
      already perished by a clear proof, should perish, and he, would had 
      already come to life by a clear proof, should live. And certainly ALLAH is 
      All-Hearing, All-Knowing. <BR>43. When ALLAH showed them to thee in thy 
      dream as few and if HE had shown them to thee as many, you would certainly 
      have faltered and would have disagreed with one another about the matter; 
      but ALLAH saved you. Surely, HE has full knowledge of what is in your 
      breasts. <BR>44. And remember when at the time of your encounter, HE made 
      them appear to you as few in your eyes, and made you appear as few in 
      their eyes, that ALLAH might bring about the thing that was decreed. And 
      to ALLAH are all affairs referred for final decision. <BR>45. O ye who 
      believe ! When you encounter an army, be firm and remember ALLAH much that 
      you may prosper.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
