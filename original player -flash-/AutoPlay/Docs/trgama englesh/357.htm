    <TD>54. Say, `Obey ALLAH, and obey the Messenger.' But if you turn away, 
      he is responsible for what he is charged with and you are responsible for 
      what you are charged with. And if you obey him, you will be rightly 
      guided. And the Messenger is only responsible for the plain delivery of 
      the Message. <BR>55. ALLAH has promised to those among you who believe and 
      do good works that HE will, surely, make them successors in the earth, as 
      HE made Successors from among those who were before them; and that HE 
      will, surely, establish for them their religion which HE has chosen for 
      them; and that HE will, surely, give them in exchange security and peace 
      after their fear; They will worship ME and they will not associate 
      anything with ME. Then whoso disbelieves after that, they will be the 
      rebellious. <BR>56. And observe Prayer and give the Zakat and obey the 
      Messenger, that you may be shown Mercy. <BR>57. Think not that those who 
      disbelieve can frustrate Our design in the earth; their abode is Hell; and 
      it is indeed evil resort. <BR>58. O ye who believe ! let those whom your 
      right hand possess, and those of you, who have not reached puberty, ask 
      leave of you at three times before coming into your private apartments 
      -before the Morning Prayer, and when you lay aside your clothes at noon 
      (in summer) and after the night Prayer. These are the three times of 
      privacy for you. At other times there is no blame on you nor on them, for 
      some of you have to attend upon others and to move about freely according 
      to need. Thus does ALLAH make plain to you the Signs; for ALLAH is 
      All-Knowing, Wise.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
