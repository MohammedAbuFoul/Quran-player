    <TD>1. Alif, Lam, Mim. <BR>2. The revelation of the Book - there is no 
      doubt about it - is from the Lord of the worlds. <BR>3. Do they say, `He 
      has forged it ?' Nay, it is the truth from thy Lord, that thou mayest warn 
      a people to whom no Warner has come before thee, that they may be guided. 
      <BR>4. ALLAH is HE Who created the heavens and the earth, and that which 
      is between them, in six periods, then HE settled Himself on the Throne. 
      You have no helper or intercessor beside HIM. Will you not then reflect ? 
      <BR>5. HE will plan HIS ordinance from the heaven unto the earth, then 
      will it go up to HIM in a day the duration of which is a thousand years 
      according as you reckon. <BR>6. Such is the knower of the unseen and the 
      seen, the Mighty, the Merciful; <BR>7. Who has made perfect everything HE 
      has created. And HE began the creation of man from clay; <BR>8. Then HE 
      made his progeny from an extract of an insignificant fluid; <BR>9. Then HE 
      endowed him with perfect faculties and breathed into him of HIS spirit. 
      And HE has given you ears, and eyes, and hearts. But little thanks do you 
      give ! <BR>10. And they say, `What ! when we are lost in the earth, shall 
      we be raised up in the form of a new creation ?' Nay, but they disbelieve 
      in the meeting with their Lord. <BR>11. Say, `The angel of death that has 
      been put in charge of you will cause you to die; then to your Lord will 
      you be brought back.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
