    <TD>32. And arrange marriages for widows from among you, and for your male 
      slaves and female slaves who are fit for marriage. If they be poor, ALLAH 
      will grant them means out of HIS bounty; and ALLAH is Bountiful, 
      All-Knowing. <BR>33. And let those who find no means of marriage keep 
      themselves chaste, until ALLAH grants them means out of HIS bounty. And 
      such as desire a deed of manumission in writing from among those whom your 
      right hands possess, write it for them if you know any good in them; and 
      give them out of the wealth of ALLAH which HE has bestowed upon you. And 
      force not your maids into unchaste life by keeping them unmarried if they 
      desire to keep chaste, in order that you may seek the gain of the present 
      life. But if anyone forces them, then after their compulsion ALLAH will be 
      Forgiving and Merciful to them. <BR>34. And WE have sent down to you 
      manifest Signs, and have related to you the example of those who have 
      passed away before you, and an admonition to the God-fearing. <BR>35. 
      ALLAH is the light of the heavens and the earth. HIS light is as if there 
      were a lustrous niche, wherein is a lamp. The lamp is inside a 
      glass-globe. The globe is, as it were, a glittering star. The lamp is lit 
      from the oil of a blessed tree -an olive - neither of the East nor of the 
      West, whose oil well-nigh would shine forth even though fire touched it 
      not. Light upon light ! ALLAH guides to HIS light whomsoever HE pleases. 
      And ALLAH sets forth parables for men, and ALLAH knows all things full 
      well. <BR>36. This light illumines houses with regard to which ALLAH has 
      ordained that they be exalted and that HIS name be remembered in them. 
      Therein do glorify HIM in the mornings and the 
  evenings.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
