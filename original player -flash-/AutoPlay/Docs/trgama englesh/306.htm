    <TD>12. God said, `O Yahya, hold fast the Book.' And WE gave him wisdom 
      while yet a child, <BR>13. And tenderness of heart from US and purity, and 
      he was pious, <BR>14. And dutiful towards his parents. And he was not 
      haughty and rebellious. <BR>15. And peace was on him the day he was born, 
      and the day he died, and peace will be on him the day he will be raised up 
      to life again. <BR>16. And relate the story of Mary as mentioned in the 
      Book, when she withdrew from her people to an eastern place; <BR>17. And 
      screened herself off from them. Then WE sent OUR angel to her and he 
      appeared to her in the form of a well proportioned man. <BR>18. She said, 
      `I seek refuge with the Gracious God from thee if indeed thou dost fear 
      HIM.' <BR>19. The angel said, `I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I 
      may give thee glad tidings of a righteous son.' <BR>20. She said, `How can 
      I have a son when no man has touched me, neither have I been unchaste ?' 
      <BR>21. The angel said, `Thus it shall be.' But says thy Lord, `It is easy 
      for ME; and WE shall do so that WE may make him a Sign unto men, and a 
      mercy from US, and it is a thing decreed.' <BR>22. So she conceived him, 
      and withdrew with him to a remote place. <BR>23. And the pains of 
      child-birth drove her unto the trunk of a palm-tree. She said, `O, would 
      that I had died before this and had become a thing quite forgotten ! 
      <BR>24. Then the angel called her from beneath her, saying, `Grieve not. 
      Thy Lord has placed a rivulet below thee; <BR>25. `And shake towards 
      thyself the trunk of the palm-tree; it will drop upon thee fresh ripe 
      dates;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
