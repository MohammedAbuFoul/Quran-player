    <TD>28. Nay, that which they used to hide before has now become clear to 
      them. And if they were sent back, they would surely return to that which 
      they are forbidden. And they are certainly liars. <BR>29. And they say, 
      `There is nothing except this our present life, and we shall not be raised 
      again.' <BR>30. And if thou couldst only see when they are made to stand 
      before their Lord, HE will say, `Is not this second life the truth ? They 
      will say, `Yea, by our Lord.' HE will say, `Then taste the punishment 
      because you disbelieved.' <BR>31. Those indeed are the losers who deny the 
      meeting with ALLAH, so much so, that when the Hour shall come on them 
      unawares, they will say, `O our grief for our neglecting this Hour !' And 
      they shall bear their burdens on their backs. Surely, evil is that which 
      they bear. <BR>32. And the life of this world is nothing but a sport and 
      pastime. And surely the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are 
      righteous. Will you not then understand ? <BR>33. WE know indeed that what 
      they say grieves thee; for surely it is not thee that they charge with 
      falsehood but it is the Signs of ALLAH that the evil-doers reject. <BR>34. 
      And the Messengers indeed have been rejected before thee, but 
      notwithstanding their rejection and persecution they remained patient 
      until OUR help came to them. There is none to change the words of ALLAH. 
      And there have already come to thee some of the tidings of the past 
      Messengers. <BR>35. And if their turning away is hard on thee, then, if 
      thou art able to seek a passage into the earth or a ladder unto heaven and 
      bring them a Sign, thou canst do so. And had ALLAH enforced HIS will, HE 
      could surely have brought them all together to the guidance. So be thou 
      not of those who lack 
knowledge.&nbsp;</TD></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
