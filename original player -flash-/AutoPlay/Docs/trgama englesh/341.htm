    <TD>73. O men, a similitude is set forth, so listen to it. Surely those on 
      whom you call upon instead of ALLAH cannot create even a fly, though they 
      should all combine together for the purpose. And if the fly should snatch 
      away anything from them, they cannot recover it therefrom. Weak, indeed, 
      are both the seeker and the sought. <BR>74. They have not formed a true 
      concept of the attributes of ALLAH. Surely, ALLAH is powerful, Mighty. 
      <BR>75. ALLAH chooses HIS Messengers from among angels and from among men. 
      Surely, ALLAH is All-Hearing, All-Seeing. <BR>76. HE knows what is before 
      them and what is behind them, and to ALLAH are all affairs returned for 
      decision. <BR>77. O ye who believe ! bow you down and prostrate yourselves 
      in Prayer, and worship your Lord, and do good deeds that you may prosper. 
      <BR>78. And strive in the cause of ALLAH as it behoves you to strive for 
      it. HE has chosen you and has laid no hardship upon you in the matter of 
      religion; so follow the faith of your father Abraham; HE has named you 
      Muslims both before and in this Book, so that the Messenger may be a 
      witness over you, and you may be witnesses over mankind. Therefore observe 
      Prayer and pay the Zakaat, and hold fast to ALLAH. HE is your Protector 
      and an Excellent Protector and an Excellent Helper
