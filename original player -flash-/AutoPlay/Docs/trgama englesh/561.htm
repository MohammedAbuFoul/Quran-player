    <TD>8. O ye who believe ! turn to ALLAH in sincere repentance. It may be 
      that your Lord will remit the evil effects of your deeds and admit you 
      into Gardens through which streams flow, on the day when ALLAH will not 
      abase the Prophet nor those who have believed with him. Their light will 
      run before them and on their right hands. They will say, `Our Lord, 
      perfect our light for us and forgive us; surely, Thou hast power over all 
      things.' <BR>9. O Prophet ! strive hard against the disbelievers and the 
      Hypocrites; and be stern with them; their resort is Hell, and an evil 
      destination it is ! <BR>10. ALLAH sets forth an example for those who 
      disbelieve, the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were under two 
      righteous servants of Ours, but they acted treacherously to them. So they 
      availed them naught against ALLAH, and it was said to them, `Enter the 
      Fire, ye twain, along with those who enter it.' <BR>11. And ALLAH holds 
      forth as an example, for those who believe, the wife of Pharaoh when she 
      said, `My Lord ! build for me a house with Thee in the Garden; and deliver 
      me from Pharaoh and his work, and deliver me from the wrongdoing people; 
      <BR>12. And sets forth as an example Mary, the daughter of Imran, who 
      guarded her chastity - so WE breathed into him of Our Spirit -and she 
      fulfilled the prophecy conveyed to her in the words of her Lord contained 
      in HIS Books and she was one of the 
obedient.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
