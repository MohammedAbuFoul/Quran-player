    <TD>211. Ask the Children of Israel how many clear Signs WE gave them. But 
      whoso changes the gift of ALLAH after it has come to him, surely then, 
      ALLAH is Severe in punishing.<BR>212. The life of this world is made to 
      appear attractive to those who disbelieve; and they scoff at those who 
      believe. But those who fear God shall be above them on the day of 
      Resurrection; and ALLAH bestows HIS gifts on whomsoever HE pleases without 
      reckoning. <BR>213. Mankind were one community, then they differed among 
      themselves, so ALLAH raised Prophets as bearers of good tidings and as 
      warners, and sent down with them the book containing the truth that HE 
      might judge between the people wherein they differed. But then they began 
      to differ about the Book, and none differed about it except those to whom 
      it was given, after clear Signs had come to them, out of envy towards one 
      another. Now has ALLAH, by HIS command, guided the believers to the truth 
      in regard to which they (the unbelievers) differed; and ALLAH guides 
      whomsoever HE pleases to the right path.<BR>214. Do you think that you 
      will enter heaven while there has not come to you the like of that which 
      came to those who passed away before you ? Poverty and afflictions befell 
      them and they were violently shaken until the Messenger and those who 
      believe along with him said, `When will the help of ALLAH come ?' Yea, 
      surely the help of ALLAH is nigh. <BR>215. They ask thee what they shall 
      spend. Say, `Whatever of good and abundant wealth you spend should be for 
      parents and near relatives and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer. And 
      whatever good you do, surely ALLAH knows it perfectly 
well.'</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
