    <TD>1. Ha Mim. <BR>2. `Ain Sin Qaf. <BR>3. Thus does ALLAH, the Mighty, 
      the Wise, send revelation to thee as HE revealed to those before thee. 
      <BR>4. To HIM belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the 
      earth, and HE is the High, the Great. <BR>5. The heavens may well-nigh 
      rend asunder from above them; and the angels proclaim the praises of their 
      Lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth. Behold ! it is, surely, ALLAH 
      Who is the Most Forgiving, the Merciful. <BR>6. And as for those who take 
      for themselves protectors beside HIM- ALLAH watches over them, and thou 
      art not a guardian over them. <BR>7. Thus have WE revealed to thee the 
      Qur'an in Arabic, that thou mayest warn the Mother of towns, and all those 
      around it; and that thou mayest warn them of the Day of Gathering, whereof 
      there is no doubt; when a party will be in the Garden and a party in the 
      blazing Fire. <BR>8. And if ALLAH had so willed, HE could have made them 
      one people; but HE admits into HIS mercy whomsoever HE pleases. The 
      wrongdoers will have no protector and no helper. <BR>9. Have they taken 
      for themselves protectors other than HIM ? But it is ALLAH Who is the real 
      Protector. And HE quickens the dead, and HE has power over all things. 
      <BR>10. And in whatsoever you differ, the final decision thereof rests 
      with ALLAH. Say, `Such is ALLAH, my Lord; in HIM I put my trust, and to 
      HIM I always turn.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
