    <TD>49. And remember the time when WE delivered you from Pharaoh's people 
      who afflicted you with grievous torment, slaying your sons and sparing 
      your women; and in that was a great trial for you from your Lord. <BR>50. 
      And remember also the time when WE divided the sea for you and saved you 
      and drowned Pharaoh's people while you looked on. <BR>51. And when WE made 
      Moses a promise of forty nights, then you took the calf for worship in his 
      absence and you were the transgressors. <BR>52. Then WE forgave you 
      thereafter, that you may be grateful. <BR>53. And remember when WE gave 
      Moses the Book and the Discrimination, that you may be rightly 
      guided.<BR>54. And when Moses said to his people, `O my people, you have 
      indeed wronged yourselves by taking the calf for worship; turn ye 
      therefore to your Maker, and kill your evil desires; that is best for you 
      in the sight of your Maker.' Then HE turned towards you with compassion. 
      Surely HE is Oft-Returning with compassion and is Merciful. <BR>55. And 
      remember when you said, `O Moses, we will not believe thee until we see 
      ALLAH face to face;' Then the thunderbolt overtook you, while you 
      witnessed with your own eyes the consequences of your conduct. <BR>56. The 
      We raised you up after your death that you might be grateful. <BR>57. And 
      WE caused the clouds to be a shade over you and sent down on you Manna and 
      Salwa, saying, `Eat of the good things We have provided for you.' And they 
      wronged us not, but it was themselves that they wronged.
