    <TD>103. And indeed WE know that they say that it is only a man who 
      teaches him. But the tongue of him towards whom their minds is inclined in 
      making this insinuation is foreign while this is Arabic tongue plain and 
      clear. <BR>104. As to those who do not believe in the Signs of ALLAH, 
      surely, ALLAH will not guide them, and they shall have a grievous 
      punishment. <BR>105. It is only those who believe not in the Signs of 
      ALLAH, who forge falsehood, and they it is who are the liars. <BR>106. 
      Whoso disbelieves in ALLAH after he has believed - save him who is forced 
      to make a declaration of disbelief while his heart finds peace in faith - 
      but such as open their breast to disbelief, on them is ALLAH's wrath; and 
      for them is decreed a severe punishment. <BR>107. That is because they 
      have preferred the present life to the Hereafter, and because ALLAH guides 
      not the disbelieving people. <BR>108. It is they on whose hearts and ears 
      and eyes ALLAH has set a seal. And it is they who are the heedless. 
      <BR>109. Undoubtedly, it is they who will be the loses in the Hereafter. 
      <BR>110. Then, surely thy Lord - to those who migrated after they had been 
      persecuted and the strove hard in the cause of ALLAH and remained 
      steadfast - surely, after that, thy Lord is Most Forgiving, 
    Merciful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
