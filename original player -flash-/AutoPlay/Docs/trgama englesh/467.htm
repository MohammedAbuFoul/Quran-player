    <TD>75. And thou wilt see the angels going round the Throne, glorifying 
      their Lord with HIS praise, and judgment will be given between the people 
      with justice. And it will be said, `All praise belongs to ALLAH, the Lord 
      of the worlds.'<BR>&nbsp;

      1. Ha Mim. <BR>2. The revelation of this Book is from ALLAH, the Mighty, 
      the All-Knowing. <BR>4. Forgiver of sin, Acceptor of repentance, Severe in 
      punishment, the Lord of Bounty. There is no god but HE. Towards HIM is the 
      final return. <BR>4. None disputes concerning the Signs of ALLAH except 
      those who disbelieve. Let not, then, their going about in the land deceive 
      thee. <BR>5. Before them the people of Noah and other groups after them 
      rejected Our Signs and every nation strove to seize their Messenger, and 
      disputed by means of false arguments that they might rebut the truth 
      thereby. Then I seized them, and how terrible was MY retribution ! <BR>6. 
      And thus was the word of thy Lord fulfilled against the disbelievers, that 
      they are the inmates of the Fire. <BR>7. Those who bear the Throne and 
      those who are around it, proclaim the praise of their Lord and believe in 
      HIM, and ask forgiveness for those who believe, saying, `Our Lord, Thou 
      dost comprehend all things in Thy mercy and knowledge. So forgive those 
      who repent and follow Thy way, and protect them from the punishment of 
      Hell;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
