    <TD>51. O ye who believe ! take not the Jews and the Christians for 
      friends. They are friends of each other. And whoso among you takes them 
      for friends is indeed one of them. Verily ALLAH guides not the unjust 
      people. <BR>52. And thou wilt see those in whose hearts is a disease, 
      hastening towards them saying, `We fear lest a misfortune befall us.' 
      Maybe, ALLAH will bring about victory or some other event from Himself. 
      Then will they regret what they hid in their minds. <BR>53. And those who 
      believe will say, `Are these they who swore by ALLAH, their most solemn 
      oaths that they were surely with you ?' Their works are vain and they have 
      become the losers. <BR>54. O ye who believe ! whoso among you turns back 
      from his Religion, then let him know that ALLAH will soon bring in his 
      stead a people whom HE will love and who will love HIM and who will be 
      kind and humble to the believers, and hard and firm against the 
      disbelievers. They will strive in the cause of ALLAH and will not fear the 
      reproach of a fault-finder. That is ALLAH's grace; HE bestows it upon 
      whomsoever HE pleases and ALLAH is Bountiful, All-Knowing. <BR>55. Your 
      friend is ALLAH and HIS Messenger and the believers who observe Prayer and 
      pay the Zakaat and worship God alone. <BR>56. And those who take ALLAH and 
      HIS Messenger and the believers for friends should rest assured that it is 
      the party of ALLAH that must triumph. <BR>57. O ye who believe ! take not 
      those for friends who make a jest and sport of your religion from among 
      those who were given the Book before you, and the disbelievers. And fear 
      ALLAH if you are believers; &nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
