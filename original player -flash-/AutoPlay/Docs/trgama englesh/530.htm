    <TD>28. `And tell them that the water is shared between her and them, 
      every drinking time shall be attended.' <BR>29. But they called their 
      comrade and he seized a sword and hamstrung her. <BR>30. How terrible, 
      then, was MY punishment and how true MY warning ! <BR>31. WE sent against 
      them a single blast, and they became like the dry stubble, whittled down 
      by a maker of hedges. <BR>32. And, indeed, WE have made the Qur'an easy to 
      remember. But is there anyone who will take heed ? <BR>33. Lot's people 
      also rejected the Warners. <BR>34. WE sent a storm of stones upon them 
      except the family of Lot, whom WE delivered by early dawn, <BR>35. As a 
      favour from US. Thus do WE reward him who is grateful. <BR>36. And he, 
      indeed, had warned them of Our severe punishment, but they doubted the 
      warning. <BR>37. And they deceitfully sought to turn him away from his 
      guests. So WE blinded their eyes, and said, `Taste ye now MY punishment 
      and MY warning.' <BR>38. And there came upon them early in the morning a 
      lasting punishment. <BR>39. `Now taste ye MY punishment and MY warning.' 
      <BR>40. And, indeed, WE have made the Qur'an easy to remember. But is 
      there anyone who will take heed ? <BR>41. And, surely, to the people of 
      Pharaoh also came Warners. <BR>42. They rejected all Our Signs. So WE 
      seized them like the seizing of the Mighty, the Powerful. <BR>43. Are your 
      disbelievers better than those ? Or, have you an immunity in the 
      Scriptures ? <BR>44. Do they say, `We are a victorious host ?' <BR>45. The 
      hosts shall soon be routed and shall turn their backs in flight. <BR>46. 
      Aye, the Hour is their promised time; and the Hour will be most calamitous 
      for them and most bitter. <BR>47. Surely, the guilty are in manifest error 
      and suffer from madness. <BR>48. On the day when they will be dragged into 
      the Fire on their faces, it will be said to them, `Taste ye the touch of 
      Hell.' <BR>49. Verily, WE have created everything in due 
  measure.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
