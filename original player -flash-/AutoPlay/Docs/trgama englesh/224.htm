    <TD>20. Such can never frustrate God's plan in the land nor have they any 
      friends besides ALLAH. Punishment will be doubled for them. They can 
      neither hear, nor can they see. <BR>21. It is these who have ruined their 
      souls, and that which they fabricated shall fail them. <BR>22. 
      Undoubtedly, it is they who shall be the greatest losers in the Hereafter. 
      <BR>23. Verily, those who believe and do good works, and humble themselves 
      before their Lord - these are the dwellers of Heaven; therein shall they 
      abide forever. <BR>24. The case of two parties is like that of the blind 
      and deaf, and the seeing and the hearing. Is the case of the two alike ? 
      Will you not then understand ? <BR>25. And WE sent Noah to his people, and 
      he said, `Truly, I am a plain Warner to you, <BR>26. That you worship none 
      but ALLAH. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a grievous day.' 
      <BR>27. The chiefs of his people, who disbelieved, replied, `We see thee 
      nothing but a mortal like ourselves, and we see that none have followed 
      thee but those who, to all outward appearance, are the meanest of us. And 
      we do not see in you any superiority over us; nay, we believe you to be 
      liars.' <BR>28. He said, `O my people, tell me if I stand on a clear proof 
      from my Lord and HE has bestowed upon me from Himself a great mercy which 
      has remained obscure to you, how will it fare with you ? Shall we force it 
      upon you, while you are averse thereto
