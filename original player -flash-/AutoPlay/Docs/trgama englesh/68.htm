    <TD>141. And that ALLAH may purify those who believe, and destroy the 
      disbelievers. <BR>142. Do you suppose that you will enter Heaven while 
      ALLAH has not yet caused to be distinguished those of you that strive in 
      the way of ALLAH and has not yet caused to be distinguished the steadfast. 
      <BR>143. And you used to wish for such a death before you met it; now you 
      have seen it face to face, then why do some of you seek to avoid it. 
      <BR>144. And Muhammad is but a messenger. Verily all Messengers have 
      passed away before him. If then he dies or is slain, will you turn back on 
      your heels ? And he who turns back on his heels shall not harm ALLAH at 
      all. And ALLAH will certainly reward the grateful. <BR>145. And no soul 
      can die except by ALLAH's leave, - a decree with a fixed term. And whoever 
      desires the reward of the present world, WE will give him thereof; and 
      whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, WE will give him thereof; and 
      WE will surely reward the grateful. <BR>146. And many a Prophet there has 
      been beside whom fought numerous companies of their followers. They 
      slacken not for aught that befell them in the way of ALLAH nor did they 
      weaken, nor did they humiliate themselves before the enemy. And ALLAH 
      loves the steadfast. <BR>147. And they uttered not a word except that they 
      said, `Our Lord forgive us our sins and our excesses in our conduct, and 
      make firm our steps and help us against the disbelieving people. <BR>148. 
      So ALLAH gave them the reward of this world, and also an excellent reward 
      of the Hereafter; and ALLAH loves those who do 
good.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
