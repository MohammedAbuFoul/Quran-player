    <TD>16. Say to the desert Arabs who contrived to be left behind, `You 
      shall be called to fight against a people of mighty valour; you shall 
      fight them until they surrender. Then, if you obey, ALLAH will give you a 
      good reward, but if you turn your backs, as you turned your backs before, 
      HE will punish you with a painful punishment.' <BR>17. There is no blame 
      on the blind, nor is there blame on the lame, nor is there blame on the 
      sick, if they go not forth to fight. And whoso obeys ALLAH and HIS 
      Messenger, HE will cause them to enter the Gardens beneath which streams 
      flow; but whoso turns his back, him will HE punish with a grievous 
      punishment. <BR>18. Surely, ALLAH was well-pleased with the believers when 
      they were swearing allegiance to thee under the Tree, and HE knew what was 
      in their hearts, and HE sent down tranquility on them, and HE rewarded 
      them with a victory at hand, <BR>19. And great spoils that they will take. 
      ALLAH is Mighty, Wise. <BR>20. ALLAH has promised you great spoils that 
      you will take and HE has given you this in advance, and has restrained the 
      hands of men from you, that it may be a Sign for the believers, and that 
      HE may guide you on a right path; <BR>21. And HE has promised you another 
      victory which you have not been able to achieve yet, but ALLAH has, 
      surely, compassed it. And ALLAH has power over all things. <BR>22. And if 
      those who disbelieve should fight you, they would, certainly, turn their 
      backs; then they would find neither protector nor helper. <BR>23. Such has 
      ever been the law of ALLAH; and thou shalt not find any change in the law 
      of ALLAH.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
