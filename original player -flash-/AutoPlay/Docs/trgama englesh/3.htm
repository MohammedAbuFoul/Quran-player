    <TD>6. Those who have disbelieved - it being alike to them whether thou 
      warn them or warn them not - they will not believe. <BR>7. ALLAH has set a 
      seal on their hearts and their ears, and over their eyes is a covering; 
      and for them is a grievous chastisement. <BR>8. And of the people there 
      are some who say, `We believe in believe in ALLAH, and the Last Day;' 
      while they are not believers at all. <BR>9. They would deceive ALLAH and 
      those who believe, but they deceive none but themselves; only they 
      perceive it not. <BR>10. In their hearts was a disease, so ALLAH has 
      increased their disease, and for them is a grievous punishment because 
      they lied. <BR>11. And when it is said to them, `Create not disorder in 
      the earth,' they say `We are only promoters of peace.' <BR>12. Beware ! it 
      is surely they who create disorder, but they do not perceive it. <BR>13. 
      And when it is said to them, `Believe as other people have believed,' they 
      say, `Shall we believe as the fools have believed ?' Remember ! it is 
      surely they that are the fools, but they do not know. <BR>14. And when 
      they meet those who believe, they say, `We believe;' but when they are 
      alone with their ring-leaders they say, `We were only mocking.' <BR>15. 
      ALLAH will punish their mockery and will let them continue in their 
      transgression, wandering blindly. <BR>16. These are they who have bartered 
      away guidance for error, but their traffic has brought them no gain, nor 
      are they rightly guided.&nbsp; </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
