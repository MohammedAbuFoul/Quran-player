    <TD>32. They seek to extinguish the light of ALLAH with their mouths; but 
      ALLAH refuses but to perfect HIS light, though the disbelievers may resent 
      it. <BR>33. HE it is Who has sent HIS Messenger with guidance and the 
      religion of truth, that HE may make it prevail over every other religion, 
      even though the idolaters may resent it. <BR>34. O ye who believe ! 
      surely, many of the priest and the monks devour the wealth of men by false 
      means and turn men away from the way of ALLAH. And those who hoard gold 
      and silver and spend it not in the way of ALLAH - give to them the tidings 
      of a painful punishment. <BR>35. On the day it shall be made hot in the 
      fire of Hell, and their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be 
      branded therewith and it shall be said to them: `This is what you hoarded 
      for yourselves; so now taste what you hoard.' <BR>36. The number of months 
      with ALLAH is twelve months by ALLAH's ordinance since the day when HE 
      created the heavens and the earth. Of these four are sacred. That is the 
      right religion. So wrong not yourselves therein. And fight the idolaters 
      all together; and know that ALLAH is with those who fear 
  HIM.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
