    <TD>59. And nothing could hinder US from sending Signs, except that the 
      former people rejected them, but this did not hinder US. And WE gave 
      Thamud the she-camel as a clear Sign, but they unjustly restricted it. And 
      WE send not Signs but to warn. <BR>60. And call to mind when WE said to 
      thee, `Surely, thy Lord has decreed the ruin of this people.' And WE made 
      not the vision which WE showed thee but as a trial for men, as also the 
      tree cursed in the Qur'an. And WE continue to warn them, but it only 
      increases them in great transgression. <BR>61. And call to mind when WE 
      said to the angels, `Submit to Adam,' and they all submitted. But Iblis 
      did not. He said, `Shall I submit to one whom Thou hast created of Clay ?' 
      <BR>62. And he said, `What thinkest thou ? Can this whom thou hast 
      honoured above me be my superior ? If Thou wilt grant me respite till the 
      Day of Resurrection, I will most surely bring his descendants under my 
      sway except a few.' <BR>63. ALLAH said, `Begone ! and whoso follow thee 
      from them, Hell shall surely be the recompense of you all - a full 
      recompense; <BR>64. And entice whomsoever of them thou canst with thy 
      voice, and urge against them thy horsemen and thy footmen and share with 
      them in wealth, and their children, and make promises to them.' And Satan 
      promises them naught but deceit. <BR>65. As to MY servants, thou shalt 
      certainly have no power over them, and sufficient is thy Lord as a 
      Guardian. <BR>66. Your Lord is HE WHO drives for you the ships in the sea, 
      that you may seek of HIS bounty. Surely, HE is Ever-Merciful towards 
    you.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
