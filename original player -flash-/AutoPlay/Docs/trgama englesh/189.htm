    <TD>14. Fight them, that ALLAH may punish them at your hands, and 
      humiliate then, and help you to victory over them, and relieve the minds 
      of a people who believe; <BR>15. And that HE may remove the anger of their 
      hearts. And ALLAH turns with mercy to whomsoever HE pleases. And ALLAH is 
      All-Knowing, Wise. <BR>16. Do you think that you would be left in peace, 
      while ALLAH has not yet known those of you who strive in the cause of 
      ALLAH and do not take anyone for an intimate friend besides ALLAH and HIS 
      Messenger and the believers ? And ALLAH is well-Aware of what you do. 
      <BR>17. It is not for the idolaters to maintain the Mosques of ALLAH while 
      they bear witness against themselves to disbelief. It is they whose works 
      shall be vain, and in the Fire shall they abide forever. <BR>18. He alone 
      can maintain the Mosques of ALLAH who believers in ALLAH, and the Last 
      Day, and observes Prayer, and pays the Zakaat and fears not but ALLAH; so 
      these it is who may be rightly guided. <BR>19. Do you consider the giving 
      of drink to the pilgrims, and the maintenance of the Scared Mosque as 
      equal to the work of him who believes in ALLAH and the Last Day and 
      strives in the path of ALLAH ? They are not at all equal in the sight of 
      ALLAH and ALLAH guides not the unjust people. <BR>20. Those who believed 
      and left their homes for the sake of God and strove in the cause of ALLAH 
      with their wealth and their lives have the highest rank in the sight of 
      ALLAH. And it is they who shall 
triumph.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
