    <TD>10. Verily, those who swear allegiance to thee, indeed, swear 
      allegiance to ALLAH. The hand of ALLAH is over their hands. So whoever 
      breaks his oath, breaks it to his own loss; and whoever fulfills the 
      covenant that HE has made with ALLAH, HE will, surely, give him a great 
      reward. <BR>11. Those of the desert Arabs, who contrived to be left 
      behind, will say to thee, `Our possessions and our families kept us 
      occupied, so ask forgiveness for us.' They say with their tongues that 
      which is not in their hearts. Say, `Who can avail you aught against ALLAH, 
      if HE should attend you some harm, or if HE should intend you some benefit 
      ? Nay, ALLAH is Well-Aware of what you do.' <BR>12. `Nay, you though that 
      the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families, and 
      that was made to appear pleasing to your hearts, and you thought an evil 
      thought, and you were a ruined people.' <BR>13. And as for those who 
      believe not in ALLAH and HIS Messenger - WE have, surely, prepared for the 
      disbelievers a blazing fire. <BR>14. And to ALLAH belongs the Kingdom of 
      the heavens and the earth. HE forgives whom HE pleases, and punishes whom 
      he pleases. And ALLAH is Most Forgiving, ever Merciful. <BR>15. Those who 
      contrived to be left behind, will say, when you go forth to the spoils to 
      take them, `Let us follow you.' They seek to change the decree of ALLAH. 
      Say, `You shall not follow us. Thus has ALLAH said beforehand.' Then they 
      will say, `Nay, but you envy us.' That is not so; in fact they understand 
      not except a little.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
