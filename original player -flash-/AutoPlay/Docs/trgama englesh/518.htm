    <TD>1. Qaf. WE cite the glorious Qur'an (as a proof that the great 
      Resurrection is sure to take place). <BR>2. But they wonder that there has 
      come to them a Warner from among themselves. And the disbelievers say, 
      `This is a strange thing. <BR>3. `What ! when we are dead and have become 
      dust, shall we be raised up again ? That is a return far from possible.' 
      <BR>4. WE know how much the earth diminishes of them and how much it adds 
      to them, and with US is a Book that preserves everything. <BR>5. Nay, they 
      rejected the truth when it came to them, and so they are in a state of 
      confusion. <BR>6. Do they not look at the sky above them, how WE have made 
      it and adorned it, and there are no flaws in it ? <BR>7. And the earth - 
      WE have spread it out, and placed therein firm mountains; and WE have made 
      to grow therein every kind of beautiful species, <BR>8. As a means of 
      enlightenment and as a reminder to every servant that turns to US. <BR>9. 
      And WE send down from the clouds water which is full of blessings, and WE 
      produce therewith gardens and crops, <BR>10. And tall palm-trees with 
      spathes piled one above the other, <BR>11. As a provision for Our 
      servants; and WE quicken thereby a dead land. Even so shall be the 
      Resurrection. <BR>12. The people of Noah rejected the truth before them 
      and so did the people of the Well and the tribe of Thamud, <BR>13. And the 
      tribe of AD, and Pharaoh and the brethren of Lot, <BR>14. And the dwellers 
      of the Wood, and the people of Tubba. All of them rejected the Messengers 
      with the result that MY threatened punishment befell them. <BR>15. Were WE 
      then wearied by the first creation ? Nay, but they are in confusion about 
      the new creation.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
