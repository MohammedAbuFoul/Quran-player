    <TD>55. Verily, the inmates of heaven will, on that day, be happy in their 
      occupation. <BR>56. They and their wives will be in pleasant shades, 
      reclining on raised couches. <BR>57. They will have fruits therein, and 
      they will have whatever they call for. <BR>58. They will be greeted with 
      Peace - a word of greeting from the Merciful Lord. <BR>59. And God will 
      say, `Separate yourselves from the righteous this day, O ye guilty ones ! 
      <BR>60. `Did I not enjoin on you, O ye sons of Adam, that you worship not 
      Satan - for he is to you an open enemy - <BR>61. `And that you worship ME 
      ? This is the right path. <BR>62. `And he did lead astray a great 
      multitude of you. Why did you not then understand ? <BR>63. `This is Hell 
      which you were promised, <BR>64. `Enter it this day because you 
      disbelieved.' <BR>65. This day we shall put a seal on their mouths, and 
      their hands will speak to US, and their feet will bear witness to what 
      they had earned. <BR>66. And if WE had so willed, WE could have put out 
      their eyes, then they would have rushed unseeing to find the way. But, how 
      could they see ? <BR>67. And if WE had so willed, WE could have 
      transformed them in their places, then they would not be able to move 
      forward or turn back. <BR>68. And him whom WE grant long life - WE revert 
      him to a weak state in creation. Will they not then understand ? <BR>69. 
      And WE have not taught him poetry, nor does it behove him to be a poet. It 
      is but a reminder and a Qur'an that expounds and makes things plain, 
      <BR>70. That it may warn all who are alive, and that the decree of ALLAH 
      may be fulfilled concerning the 
disbelievers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
