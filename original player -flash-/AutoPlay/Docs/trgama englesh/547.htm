    <TD>10. And for those who came after them. They say, `Our Lord, forgive us 
      and our brothers who preceded us in the Faith, and leave not any rancour 
      in our hearts against those who believe. Our Lord, Thou art, indeed, 
      Compassionate, Merciful. <BR>11. Seest thou not the Hypocrites ? They say 
      to their brethren who disbelieve from among the People of the Book, `If 
      you are turned out of Medina, we will, surely, go out with you and we will 
      never obey anyone against you, and if you are fought against, we will, 
      certainly, help you. But ALLAH bears witness that, surely, they are the 
      liars. <BR>12. If they are turned out, they will never go out with them, 
      and if they are fought against, they will never help them. And even if 
      they help them, they will, certainly, turn their backs, and then they 
      themselves shall not be helped. <BR>13. Assuredly, they have greater fear 
      of you in their hearts than of ALLAH. That is because they are a people 
      who understand not. <BR>14. They will not fight you in a body except in 
      strongly fortified towns or from behind the walls. Their fighting among 
      themselves is severe. Thou thinkest them to be united, but their hearts 
      are divided. That is because they are a people who have no sense. <BR>15. 
      Their case is like the case of those people who passed away only a short 
      time before them. They tasted the evil consequences of their evil conduct. 
      And for them is a painful punishment. <BR>16. Or it is like that of Satan, 
      when he says to man, `Disbelieve,' but when he disbelieves, he says, `I 
      have nothing to do with thee, I fear ALLAH, the Lord of the worlds.'
