    <TD>158. They are but waiting that angels should come to them or that thy 
      Lord should come or there should come some of the Signs of thy Lord. The 
      day when some of the Signs of thy Lord shall come, it shall not profit a 
      soul to believe, which had not believed before, nor earned any good by its 
      faith. Say, `Wait ye, we too are waiting.' <BR>159. As for those who split 
      up their religion and became divided into sects, thou hast no concern at 
      all with them. Surely, their affair is with ALLAH, then shall HE inform 
      them of what they used to do. <BR>160. Whoso does a good deed shall have 
      ten times as much; but he who does an evil deed, shall be requited only 
      with the like of it; and they shall not be wronged. <BR>161. Say, `My Lord 
      has guided me unto a straight path - the right religion, the religion of 
      Abraham, the upright. And he was not of those who associated gods with 
      ALLAH. <BR>162. Say, `My Prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death 
      are all for ALLAH, the Lord of the worlds; <BR>163. HE has no partner. And 
      so I am commanded, and I am the first of those who submit.' <BR>164. Say, 
      `Shall I seek a Lord, other than ALLAH while HE is the Lord of all things 
      ?' And no soul earns evil but only against itself; nor does any bearer of 
      burden bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord will be your return, 
      and HE will inform you of that wherein you used to differ. <BR>165. And HE 
      it is who made you successors of others on the earth and has exalted some 
      of you over others in degrees of rank, that HE may try you by that which 
      HE has given you. Surely, thy Lord is Quick in punishment; and surely, HE 
      is Most Forgiving, Merciful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
