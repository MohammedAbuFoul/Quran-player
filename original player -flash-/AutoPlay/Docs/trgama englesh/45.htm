    <TD>265. And the case of those who spend their wealth to seek the pleasure 
      of ALLAH and to strengthen their souls is like the case of a garden on 
      elevated ground. Heavy rain falls on it so that it brings forth its fruit 
      twofold. And if heavy rain does not fall on it, then light rain suffices. 
      And ALLAH sees what you do. <BR>266. Would any of you desire that there 
      should be for him a garden of palm tress and vines with streams flowing 
      beneath it, and with all kinds of fruit for him therein - while old age 
      has stricken him and he has weak offspring - and that a fiery whirlwind 
      should smite it and it be all burnt ? Thus does ALLAH makes HIS Signs 
      clear to you that you may reflect.<BR>267. O ye who believe ! spend of the 
      good things you have earned, and from what WE produce for you from the 
      earth; and seek not what is bad that you may spend out of it when you 
      would not take it yourselves except that you connive at it. And know that 
      ALLAH is Self-Sufficient, praiseworthy. <BR>268. Satan threatens you with 
      poverty and enjoins upon you what is foul, whereas ALLAH promises you 
      forgiveness from Himself and bounty. And ALLAH is Bountiful, All-Knowing. 
      <BR>269. HE grants wisdom to whom HE pleases, and whoever is granted 
      wisdom has indeed been granted abundant good; and none would take heed 
      except those endowed with 
understanding.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
