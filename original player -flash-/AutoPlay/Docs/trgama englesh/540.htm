    <TD>19. Those who believe in ALLAH and HIS Messengers, they are the 
      Truthful and the Witnesses in the sight of their Lord. They will have 
      their full reward and their light. But those who disbelieve and reject Our 
      Signs, these are the inmates of Hell. <BR>20. Know that the life of this 
      world is only a sport and a pastime, and an adornment, and a source of 
      boasting among yourselves, and of rivalry in multiplying riches and 
      children. It is like the rain, the vegetation produced whereby rejoices 
      the tillers. Then it dries up and thou seest it turn yellow; then it 
      becomes worthless stubble. And in the Hereafter there is severe punishment 
      for the wicked and also forgiveness from ALLAH, and His pleasure for the 
      righteous. And the life of this world is nothing but temporary enjoyment 
      of delusive things. <BR>21. Vie, then, with one another in seeking 
      forgiveness from your Lord and for a Garden the value whereof is equal to 
      the value of the heaven and the earth; it has been prepared for those who 
      believe in ALLAH and His Messengers. That is ALLAH's grace; HE bestows it 
      upon whomsoever HE pleases, and ALLAH is the Lord of immense grace. 
      <BR>22. There befalls not any calamity either in the earth or in your own 
      persons, but it is recorded in a Book before WE bring it into being - 
      surely, that is easy for ALLAH - <BR>23. That you may not grieve over what 
      is lost to you nor exult because of that which HE has bestowed upon you. 
      And ALLAH loves not any conceited boaster, <BR>24. Such as are niggardly 
      and also enjoin upon men to be niggardly. And whoso turns his back, then 
      surely, ALLAH is Self-Sufficient, Worthy of all 
praise.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
