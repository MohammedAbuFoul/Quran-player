    <TD>122. When two parties from among you, thought of showing cowardice, 
      although ALLAH was their Friend. And upon ALLAH should the believers 
      rely.<BR>123. And ALLAH had already helped you at Badr when you were weak. 
      So take ALLAH for your protector so that you may be grateful. <BR>124. 
      When thou didst say to the believers, `Will it not suffice you that your 
      Lord should help you with three thousand angels sent down from on high. 
      <BR>125. Yea, if you be steadfast and righteous and they came upon you 
      immediately in hot haste, your Lord will help you with five thousand 
      angels, attacking vehemently. <BR>126. And ALLAH has made it only as glad 
      tidings for you and to put your hearts at rest thereby; and help comes 
      from ALLAH alone, the Mighty, the Wise. <BR>127. This will be, that HE 
      might cut off a part of the disbelievers or abase them so that they may go 
      back frustrated. <BR>128. It is none of thy concern whether HE may turn to 
      them in mercy or punish them, for they are wrongdoers. <BR>129. And to 
      ALLAH belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. HE 
      forgives whomsoever HE pleases and punishes whomsoever HE pleases, and 
      ALLAH is Most Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>130. O ye who believe ! devour not 
      interest involving multiple additions, and fear ALLAH that you may 
      prosper. <BR>131. And fear the Fire which has been prepared for the 
      disbelieves. <BR>132. And obey ALLAH and the Messenger that you may be 
      shown mercy.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
