    <TD>35. And the idolaters say, `If ALLAH had so willed, we should not have 
      worshiped anything beside HIM, neither we nor our fathers, nor should we 
      have forbidden anything without command from HIM.' So did those who 
      opposed the truth before them. Are the Messengers responsible for anything 
      except the plain delivery of the Message ? <BR>36. And WE did raise among 
      every people a Messenger with the teaching, `Worship ALLAH and shun the 
      Evil one.' Then among them were some whom ALLAH guided and among them were 
      some who became deserving of ruin. So travel through the earth and see 
      what was the end of those who treated the prophets as liars ! <BR>37. If 
      thou art solicitous of their guidance, then know that ALLAH surely guides 
      not those who lead others astray. And for such there are no helpers. 
      <BR>38. And they swear by ALLAH their strongest oaths, that ALLAH will not 
      raise up those who die. Nay, HE will certainly raise them up. This is a 
      true promise the fulfillment of which is binding on HIM but most men know 
      not. <BR>39. HE will surely raise them up that HE may make clear to them 
      that wherein they differed, and that those who disbelieved may realize 
      that they were liars. <BR>40. Our word concerning a thing, when WE will 
      it, it is only that WE say to it, `Be,' and it is. <BR>41. And as to those 
      who leave their homes for the sake of ALLAH after they are wronged, WE 
      will surely give them a goodly abode in this world; and truly the reward 
      of the Hereafter is greater; if they but knew - <BR>42. Those who are 
      steadfast and put their trust in their 
Lord.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
