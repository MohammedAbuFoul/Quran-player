    <TD>9. And if WE had appointed as Messenger an angel, WE would have made 
      him appear as a man; and thus WE would have caused to be confused to them 
      that which they are themselves confusing. <BR>10. And surely the 
      Messengers have been mocked at before thee, but that which they mocked at 
      encompassed those of them who scoffed at it. <BR>11. Say, `Go about in the 
      earth and see what was the end of those who treated the Prophets as 
      liars.' <BR>12. Say, `To whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth 
      ?' Say, `To ALLAH.' HE has taken oupon Himself to show mercy. HE will 
      certainly continue to assemble you till the Day of Resurrection. There is 
      no doubt in it. Those who have ruined their souls will not believe. 
      <BR>13. To HIM belongs whatever exists in the darkness of the night and 
      the light of the day. And HE is All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. <BR>14. Say, 
      `Shall I take any protector other than ALLAH, the Maker of the heavens and 
      the earth, Who feeds and is not fed ?' Say, `I have been commanded to be 
      the first of those who submit.' And be thou not of those who associate 
      partners with ALLAH. <BR>15. Say, `Indeed I fear, if I disobey my Lord, 
      the punishment of an awful day.' <BR>16. He from whom it is averted on 
      that day, ALLAH indeed has had mercy on him. And that indeed is a manifest 
      achievement. <BR>17. And if ALLAH touch thee with affliction, there is 
      none to remove it but HE; and if HE touch thee with happiness, then HE has 
      the power to do all that HE wills. <BR>18. And HE is supreme over HIS 
      servants; and HE is the Wise, the 
All-Aware.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
