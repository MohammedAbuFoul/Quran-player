    <TD>51. `Then, O ye that have gone astray and have rejected the truth, 
      <BR>52. `You will, surely, eat of the tree of Zaqqum, <BR>53. And will 
      fill your bellies therewith, <BR>54. `And will drink boiling water, on top 
      of that, <BR>55. `Drinking as the insatiable thirsty camels drink.' 
      <BR>56. This will be their entertainment on the Day of Judgment. <BR>57. 
      WE have created you. Why, then do you not accept the truth ? <BR>58. What 
      think ye of the sperm-drop that you emit ? <BR>59. Is it you who have 
      created it, or are WE the Creator ? <BR>60. WE have ordained death for all 
      of you; and WE cannot be hindered, <BR>61. From bringing in your place 
      others like you, and from developing you into a form which you know not. 
      <BR>62. And you have, certainly, known the first creation. Why, then, do 
      you not reflect ? <BR>63. Do you see what you sow ? <BR>64. Is it you who 
      cause it to grow, or are WE the grower ? <BR>65. If WE so pleased, WE 
      could reduce it all to withered stubble, then you would keep lamenting: 
      <BR>66. `We are laden with debt ! <BR>67. `Nay, we are totally deprived of 
      everything.' <BR>68. Have you considered the water which you drink ? 
      <BR>69. Do you send it down from the clouds, or are WE the Sender ? 
      <BR>70. If WE so pleased, WE could make it bitter. Why, then, do you not 
      give thanks ? <BR>71. Have you considered the fire which you kindle ? 
      <BR>72. Is it you who produce the tree for it, or are WE the Producer ? 
      <BR>73. WE have made it a reminder and benefit for the wayfarers. <BR>74. 
      So glorify the name of thy Lord, the Great. <BR>75. Nay, I cite as proof 
      the shooting of the stars - <BR>76. And, indeed, that is a grand 
      testimony, if you only knew
