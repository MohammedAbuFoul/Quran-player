    <TD>84. And remember when WE took a covenant from you: `You shall not shed 
      each other's blood nor turn your people out of your homes,' Then you 
      confirmed it; and you have been witness to it. <BR>85. Yet you are those 
      who slay one another and turn out a section of your people from their 
      homes, backing up their enemies against them in sin and transgression. And 
      if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, while their expulsion 
      itself was unlawful for you. Do you then believe in a part of the Book and 
      disbelieve in another part ? What is then the reward of such among you as 
      do so, except disgrace in the present life; and on the Day of Judgment 
      they shall be driven to a most severe chastisement; and surely ALLAH is 
      not unmindful of what you do. <BR>86. These are they who have preferred 
      the present life to the Hereafter. Their punishment shall not, therefore, 
      be lightened, nor shall they be helped in any way. <BR>87. And verily WE 
      gave Moses the Book and caused Messengers to follow in his footsteps after 
      him; and to Jesus, son of Mary, WE gave manifest Signs, and strengthened 
      him with the Spirit of Holiness. Will you, then, every time a Messenger 
      comes to you with what you yourselves desire not, behave arrogantly and 
      treat some as liars and slay others ?<BR>88. They said `Our hearts are 
      wrapped up in covers.' Nay, ALLAH has cursed them for their disbelief. 
      Little is that which they 
believe.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
