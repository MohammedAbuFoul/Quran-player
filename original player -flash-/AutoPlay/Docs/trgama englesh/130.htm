    <TD>19. Say, `What thing is the weightiest in testimony.' Say, `ALLAH is a 
      Witness between me and you. And this Qur'an has been revealed to me so 
      that with it I may warn you, as well as whomsoever it reaches, of the 
      impending punishment. What ! do you really bear witness that there are 
      other gods besides ALLAH ?' Say, `I bear not witness thereto.' Say, `HE is 
      the One God, and certainly I am innocent of that which you associate with 
      HIM.' <BR>20. Those to whom WE gave the Book recognize him as they 
      recognize their sons. But those who ruin their souls - they will not 
      believe. <BR>21. And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against 
      ALLAH or treat HIS Signs as lies ? Surely the unjust shall not prosper. 
      <BR>22. And think of the day when WE shall gather them all together; then 
      shall WE say to those who associated partners with ALLAH, `Where are the 
      partners you spoke of - those whom you asserted ?' <BR>23. Then they will 
      have no excuse save that they shall say, `By ALLAH, our Lord, we were not 
      idolaters.' <BR>24. See how they shall lie against themselves. And that 
      which they fabricated shall fail them. <BR>25. And among them are some who 
      give ear to thee; but WE have put veils on their hearts, that they should 
      not understand, and deafness in their ears. And even if they see every 
      Sign, they would not believe therein, so much so that when they come to 
      thee, disputing with thee, those who disbelieve say, `This is nothing but 
      fables of the ancients.' <BR>26. And they forbid others to believe in it 
      and themselves too they keep away from it. And they ruin none but their 
      ownselves; only they perceive not. <BR>27. And if thou couldst only see 
      when they are made to stand before the Fire ! They will say, `Oh, would 
      that we might be sent back ! And then we would not treat the Signs of our 
      Lord as lies and we would be of the 
believers.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
