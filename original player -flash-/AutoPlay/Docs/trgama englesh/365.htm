    <TD>56. And WE have not sent thee but as a bearer of glad tidings and a 
      Warner. <BR>57. Say, `I ask of you no recompense for it, save that whoso 
      chooses may take a way that leads to his Lord.' <BR>58. And trust thou in 
      the One, Who is Ever-Living and is the Source of all life, And Who dies 
      not, and Glorify HIM with HIS praise. And sufficient is HE as the Knower 
      of the sins of his servants, <BR>59. HE Who created the Heavens and the 
      earth and all that is between them in six periods, then HE settled Himself 
      firmly on the Throne - the Gracious, God ! Ask thou then concerning HIM 
      one who knows. <BR>60. And when it is said to them, `Submit to the 
      Gracious God,' they say, `And who is the Gracious, God ? Shall we submit 
      to whatever thou biddest us ?' And it increases their aversion. <BR>61. 
      Blessed is HE Who has made in the heaven mansions of stars and has placed 
      therein a Lamp producing light and a moon that reflects light. <BR>62. And 
      HE it is Who has made the night and the day, each following the other, for 
      the benefit of him who desires to remember, or desires to be grateful. 
      <BR>63. And the true servants of the Gracious God are those who walk on 
      the earth humbly and when the ignorant address them, they avoid them 
      gracefully by saying, `Peace !' <BR>64. And who spend the night in 
      prostration and standing before their Lord, <BR>65. And who say, `Our 
      Lord, avert from us the punishment of Hell; for the punishment thereof is 
      a most vehement torment, <BR>66. `It is indeed evil as a place of rest and 
      as an abode.' <BR>67. And those who, when they spend, are neither 
      extravagant nor niggardly but adopt a moderate position in the 
    middle;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
