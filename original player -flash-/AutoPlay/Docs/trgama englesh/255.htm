    <TD>43. And those who disbelieve say, `Thou art not a Messenger.' Say, 
      `Sufficient is ALLAH as a Witness between me and you and so also is he who 
      possesses knowledge of the Book. <BR>&nbsp;
      <HR width="90%" color=#000000 SIZE=3>
      1. Alif Lam Ra. This is a Book which WE have revealed to thee that thou 
      mayest bring mankind out of the depths of darkness into light, by the 
      command of their Lord, to the path of the Mighty, the Praiseworthy -- 
      <BR>2. The path of ALLAH to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and 
      whatever is in the earth. And woe to the disbelievers for a terrible 
      punishment; <BR>3. Those who prefer the present life to the Hereafter, and 
      hinder men from the way of ALLAH and seek to make it crooked. It is these 
      who have gone far off in error. <BR>4. And WE have not sent any Messenger 
      except with revelation in the language of his people in order that he 
      might make things clear to them. Then ALLAH leaves to go astray whom HE 
      wills and guides whom HE wills. And HE is the Mighty, the Wise. <BR>5. And 
      WE sent Moses with Our Signs, saying, `Bring forth thy people from the 
      depths of darkness into light and remind them of the days of ALLAH.' 
      Surely, therein are Signs for every patient and thankful 
  person.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
