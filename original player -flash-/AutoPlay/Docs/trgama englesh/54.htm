    <TD>30. Beware of the Day when every soul shall find itself confronted 
      with all the good it has done and all the evil it has done. It will wish 
      there were a great distance between it and that evil. And ALLAH cautions 
      you against HIS punishment. And ALLAH is Most Compassionate to HIS 
      servants. <BR>31. Say `If you love ALLAH, follow me; then will ALLAH love 
      you and forgive you your sins.' And ALLAH is Most Forgiving and Merciful. 
      <BR>32. Say, `Obey ALLAH and HIS Messenger;' but if they turn away, then 
      remember that ALLAH loves not the disbelievers. <BR>33. ALLAH chose Adam 
      and Noah and the family of Abraham and the family of Imran above all 
      peoples of the time. <BR>34. They were descendants of one another and 
      ALLAH is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. <BR>35. Remember when a women of Imran 
      said, `My Lord, I have vowed to Thee what is in my womb to be dedicated to 
      Thy service. So do Thou accept it of me; Verily Thou alone art 
      All-Hearing, All-Knowing.' <BR>36. But when she was delivered of it, she 
      said, `My Lord, I am delivered of a female,' - and ALLAH knew best of what 
      she was delivered and the male she desired to have was not like the female 
      she was delivered of - `and I have named her Mary, and I commit her and 
      her offspring to Thy protection from Satan, the rejected. <BR>37. So her 
      Lord accepted her with gracious acceptance and caused her to grow an 
      excellent growth and made Zachariah her guardian. Whenever Zachariah 
      visited her in the chamber, he found with her provisions. He said, `O Mary 
      whence hast thou this ?' She replied, `It is from ALLAH.' Surely ALLAH 
      gives to whomsoever HE pleases without 
measure.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
