    <TD>58. And who, when you call people to Prayer, take it for a jest and 
      sport. This is because they are people who do not understand. <BR>59. Say, 
      `O people of the Book ! do you find fault with us because we believe in 
      ALLAH and what was sent down to us and what was sent down previously ? Or 
      is it because most of you are disobedient to ALLAH ?' <BR>60. Say, `Shall 
      I inform you of those whose reward with ALLAH is worst than that ? They 
      are those whom ALLAH has cursed and on whom HIS wrath has fallen and of 
      whom HE has made apes and swine and who worship the Evil One. These indeed 
      are in a worse plight, and father astray from the right path. <BR>61. And 
      when they come to you, they say, `WE believe,' while they enter with 
      disbelief and go out therewith; and ALLAH best knows what they hide. 
      <BR>62. And thou seest many of them hastening towards sin and 
      transgression and eating of things forbidden. Evil indeed is that which 
      they practice. <BR>63. Why do not the divines and those learned in Law 
      prohibit them from uttering sin and eating things forbidden ? Evil indeed 
      is that which they do. <BR>64. And the Jews say, `ALLAH's hand is tied 
      up.' Their own hands shall be tied up and they shall be cursed for what 
      they say. Nay, both HIS hands are wide open. HE spends as HE pleases. And 
      what has been sent down to thee from thy Lord will most surely increase 
      many of them in rebellion and disbelief. And WE have cast among them 
      enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection. Whenever they kindle a 
      fire for war, ALLAH extinguishes it. And they strive to create disorder in 
      the earth, and ALLAH love not those who create 
  disorder.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
