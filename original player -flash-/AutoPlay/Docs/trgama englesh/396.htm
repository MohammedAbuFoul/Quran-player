    <TD>85. HE who has made the teaching of the Qur'an binding on thee will 
      most surely bring thee back to thy ordained place of return. Say, `My Lord 
      knows best him who has brought the guidance, and him who is in manifest 
      error.' <BR>86. And thou didst never expect that the Book would be 
      revealed to thee; but it is a mercy from thy Lord; so never be a helper of 
      disbelievers. <BR>87. And let them not turn thee away from the Signs of 
      ALLAH, after they have been sent down to thee; and call mankind to thy 
      Lord, and be not of those who associate partners with HIM. <BR>88. And 
      call not on any other god beside ALLAH. There is no god but HE. Everything 
      will perish but HE. HIS is the judgment, and to HIM will you all be 
      brought back.<BR>&nbsp;

      1. Alif, Lam, Mim. <BR>2. Do men think that they will be left alone 
      because they say, `We believe,' and that they will not be tried ? <BR>3. 
      And WE did try those who were before them. So ALLAH will, assuredly, know 
      those who are truthful and HE will, assuredly, know the liars. <BR>4. Or, 
      those who commit evil deeds imagine that they will escape US ? How ill 
      they judge ! <BR>5. Whoso hopes to meet ALLAH, let him be prepared for it, 
      for ALLAH's appointed time is certainly coming. And HE is the All-Hearing, 
      the All-Knowing. <BR>6. And whoso strives, strives only for his own soul; 
      verily, ALLAH is Independent of all HIS 
creatures.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
