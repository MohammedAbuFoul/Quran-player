    <TD>4. HE it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods, then 
      HE settled Himself on the Throne. HE knows what enters the earth and what 
      comes out of it, and what comes down from the heaven and what goes up into 
      it. And HE is with you wheresoever you may be. And ALLAH sees all that you 
      do. <BR>5. HIS is the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and to ALLAH 
      are all affairs returned for final judgment. <BR>6. HE causes the night to 
      pass into the day and causes the day to pass into the night; And HE knows 
      well all that is in the breasts. <BR>7. Believe in ALLAH and His 
      Messenger, and spend in the way of ALLAH out of that to which HE has made 
      you heirs. And those of you who believe and spend will have a great 
      reward. <BR>8. Why is it that you believe not in ALLAH, while the 
      Messenger calls you to believe in your Lord, and HE has already taken a 
      covenant from you, if indeed you are believers ? <BR>9. HE it is Who sends 
      down clear Signs to HIS servant, that HE may bring you out of every kind 
      of darkness into light. And, verily, ALLAH is Compassionate and Merciful 
      to you. <BR>10. And why is it that you spend not in the way of ALLAH, 
      while to ALLAH belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth ? Those 
      of you who spent and fought before the Victory are not equal to those who 
      did so later. They are greater in rank than those who spent and fought 
      afterwards. And to all has ALLAH promised good. And ALLAH is Well-Aware of 
      what you do. <BR>11. Who is he who will lend to ALLAH a goodly loan ? So 
      HE will increase it manifold for him, and he will have a noble 
    reward.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
