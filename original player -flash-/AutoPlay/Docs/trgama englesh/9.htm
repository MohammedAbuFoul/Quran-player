    <TD>58. And remember the time when WE said `Enter this town and eat 
      therefrom - whatever you will - plentifully; and enter the gate 
      submissively and say, `God ! forgive us our sins.' WE shall forgive you 
      your sins and WE shall give increase to those who do good.'<BR>59. The 
      transgressors changed it for a word other than that which was said to 
      them. So WE send down upon the transgressors a punishment from heaven 
      because they were disobedient. <BR>60. And remember the time when Moses 
      prayed for water for his people and WE said, `Strike the rock with thy 
      rod;' And there gushed forth from it twelve springs, so that each tribe 
      knew their drinking place. And they were told, `Eat and drink of what 
      ALLAH has provided, and commit not iniquity in the earth, creating 
      disorder.' <BR>61. And remember when you said, O Moses, surely we will not 
      remain content with one kind of food; pray, then, to thy Lord for us that 
      HE may bring forth for us of what the earth grows - of its herbs and its 
      cucumbers and its wheat and its lentils and its onions.' He said, `Would 
      you take in exchange that which is worse for that which is better ? Go 
      down to some town and there is for you what you ask.' And they were 
      smitten with abasement and destitution, and they incurred the wrath of 
      ALLAH; that was because they rejected the Signs of ALLAH and sought to 
      slay the Prophets unjustly; this was because they rebelled and 
      transgressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
