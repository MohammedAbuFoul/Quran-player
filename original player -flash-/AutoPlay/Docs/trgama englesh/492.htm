    <TD>34. And doors of silver to their houses, and couches of silver, on 
      which they could recline, <BR>35. And even of gold, but all that is 
      nothing but a temporary provision of the present life. And the comfort of 
      the Hereafter with thy Lord is for the righteous. <BR>36. And he who turns 
      away from the remembrance of the Gracious God, WE appoint for him a satan, 
      who becomes his intimate companion. <BR>37. And, surely, these companions 
      hinder them from the way of God, but they think that they are rightly 
      guided; <BR>38. Till when, such a one comes to US, he says to his 
      companion, `Would that between me and thee were the distance of the East 
      and the West !' What an evil companion he is ! <BR>39. And it will be said 
      to them, `Your being partners in punishment will not profit you this day, 
      for you have acted wrongfully.' <BR>40. Canst thou, then, make the deaf 
      hear, or guide the blind and him who is in manifest error ? <BR>41. And if 
      WE take thee away from this world, WE shall nevertheless take vengeance 
      upon them; <BR>42. Or, WE shall show thee that which WE have promised 
      them; for, surely, WE have complete power over them. <BR>43. So hold thou 
      fast to that which has been revealed to thee; for thou art on the right 
      path. <BR>44. And, truly, this Qur'an is a source of eminence for thee and 
      for thy people; and you will, surely, be questioned. <BR>45. And ask those 
      of Our Messengers whom WE sent before thee, `Did WE appoint any deities 
      beside the Gracious God, to be worshiped ?' <BR>46. And, indeed, WE sent 
      Moses with Our Signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs and he said, `I am, truly, 
      a Messenger of the Lord of the worlds.' <BR>47. But when he came to them 
      with Our Signs, lo ! they laughed at 
them.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
