    <TD>53. They ask thee to hasten on the punishment, and had there not been 
      an appointed term, the punishment would have come upon them. And it shall, 
      surely, overtake them unexpectedly, while they perceive not. <BR>54. They 
      ask thee to hasten on the punishment; but Hell will, certainly, encompass 
      the disbelievers; <BR>55. On the day when the punishment will overwhelm 
      them from above them and from underneath their feet, and HE will say, 
      `Taste ye the fruit of your actions.' <BR>56. O MY servants who believe ! 
      verily, MY earth is vast; so worship ME alone. <BR>57. Every soul shall 
      taste of death; then to US shall you all be brought back. <BR>58. And 
      those who believe and do righteous deeds - them shall WE, surely, house in 
      lofty mansions of Paradise, beneath which streams flow. They will abide 
      therein. Excellent is the reward of those who labour for good, <BR>59. 
      Those who are steadfast, and put their trust in their Lord. <BR>60. And 
      how many an animal there is that carries not its sustenance ! ALLAH 
      provides for it and for you. And HE is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. 
      <BR>61. And if thou ask them, `Who has created the heavens and the earth 
      and pressed into service the sun and the moon ? They will, surely, say, 
      `ALLAH.' How then are they being turned away from the truth ? <BR>62. 
      ALLAH enlarges the means of sustenance for such of his servants as HE 
      pleases, and straitens them for whom HE pleases. Surely, ALLAH has full 
      knowledge of all things. <BR>63. And if thou ask them, `Who sends down 
      water from the sky and therewith gives life to the earth after its death 
      ?' They will, surely, say, `ALLAH.' Say, `All praise belongs to ALLAH.' 
      But most of them understand 
not.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
