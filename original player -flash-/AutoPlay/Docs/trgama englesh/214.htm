    <TD>43. And among them are some who look towards thee. But canst thou 
      guide the blind, even though they will not see. <BR>44. Certainly, ALLAH 
      wrongs not men at all; it is they who wrong their own souls. <BR>45. And 
      on the day when HE will gather them together, it will appear to them as 
      though they had not tarried in the world save for an hour of a day. They 
      will recognize one another. Losers indeed are those who deny the meeting 
      with ALLAH and would not follow guidance. <BR>46. And if WE show thee in 
      thy lifetime the fulfillment of some of the things with which WE have 
      threatened them, thou wilt know it; or if WE cause thee to die before 
      that, then to US is their return, and thou wilt have knowledge of it in 
      the next world; and ALLAH is Witness to all that they do. <BR>47. And for 
      every people there is a Messenger. So when their Messenger comes, it is 
      judged between them with equity, and they are not wronged. <BR>48. And 
      they say, `When will this promise be fulfilled, if you are truthful ?' 
      <BR>49. Say, `I have no power over any harm or benefit for myself save 
      that which ALLAH wills. For every people there is an appointed term. When 
      their term is come, they cannot remain behind a single moment, nor can 
      they get ahead of it.' <BR>50. Say, `Tell me, if HIS punishment come upon 
      you by night or by day, how will the guilty run away from it ? <BR>51. `Is 
      it then when it has overtaken you that you will believe in it ? What ! you 
      believe now ! And before this you used to demand its speedy coming ? 
      <BR>52. Then it will be said to those who did wrong, `Taste ye the abiding 
      punishment. You are not requited save for that which you earned.' <BR>53. 
      And they ask thee to tell them whether it is true ? Say, `Yea, by my Lord 
      ! it is most surely true; and you cannot frustrate 
it.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
