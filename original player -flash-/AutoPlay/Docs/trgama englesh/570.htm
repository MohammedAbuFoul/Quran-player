    <TD>40. But nay ! I swear by the Lord of the Easts and of the Wests that 
      WE have the power <BR>41. To bring in their place others better than they, 
      and WE cannot be frustrated in Our plans. <BR>42. So leave them alone to 
      indulge in idle talk and to sport until they meet that day of theirs which 
      they are promised, <BR>43. The day when they will come forth from their 
      graves hastening as though they were racing to a target, <BR>44. Their 
      eyes cast down; and humiliation covering them. Such is the Day which they 
      are promised. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. WE sent Noah to his people, with the commandment: `Warn thy people 
      before there comes upon them a grievous punishment.' <BR>2. He said, `O my 
      people ! surely, I am a plain Warner unto you, <BR>3. `That you serve 
      ALLAH and be mindful of your duty to HIM and obey me, <BR>4. `HE will 
      forgive you your sins and grant you respite till an appointed time.' 
      Verily, the time appointed by ALLAH cannot be put off when it comes, if 
      only you knew. <BR>5. He said, `My Lord, I have called my people night and 
      day, <BR>6. `But my calling them has only made them flee from me all the 
      more; <BR>7. `And every time I called them that Thou mightest forgive 
      them, they put their fingers into their ears, and drew close their 
      garments, and persisted in their iniquities and were disdainfully proud; 
      <BR>8. `Then, I called them to righteousness openly, <BR>9. `Then preached 
      to them in public, an appealed to them in private.' <BR>10. And I said, 
      `Seek forgiveness of your Lord; for HE is the Great 
  Forgiver;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
