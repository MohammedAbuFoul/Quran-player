    <TD>32. And of HIS signs are the sailing ships on the sea, tall like 
      mountains. <BR>33. If HE so desires HE can cause the wind to become still 
      so that they become motionless upon the surface thereof - in that, surely, 
      are Signs for every patient and grateful person <BR>34. Or HE can destroy 
      those who are in them because of that which they have earned - but HE 
      forgives many of their sins - <BR>35. And HE destroys them so that those 
      who dispute concerning Our Signs may know that they have no refuge. 
      <BR>36. And whatever you have been given is only a temporary provision of 
      this life, but that which is with ALLAH is better and more lasting for 
      those who believe and put their trust in their Lord, <BR>37. And those who 
      eschew the more grievous sins and indecencies, and, when they are wroth, 
      they forgive, <BR>38. And those, who hearken to their Lord, and observe 
      Prayer, and whose affairs are decided by mutual consultation, and who 
      spend out of what WE have provided for them, <BR>39. And those who, when a 
      wrong is done to them, defend themselves. <BR>40. Remember that the 
      recompense of an injury is an injury the like thereof; but whoso forgives 
      and thereby brings about an improvement, his reward is with ALLAH. Surely, 
      HE loves not the wrongdoers. <BR>41. There is no blame on those who defend 
      themselves after they have been wronged. <BR>42. The blame is only on 
      those who wrong men and transgress in the earth without justification. 
      Such will have a grievous punishment. <BR>43. And he who is patient and 
      forgives - that, surely, is a matter of high resolve. <BR>44. And he whom 
      ALLAH adjudges astray - there is no protector for him thereafter. And thou 
      wilt find the wrongdoers, when they see the punishment, saying, `Is there 
      any way of return ?'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
