    <TD>126. God will say, `Thus did OUR Signs come to thee and thou didst 
      ignore them and in like manner wilt thou be ignored this day.' <BR>127. 
      And thus do WE recompense him who transgresses the limits of Divine Law 
      and believes not in the Signs of his Lord; and the punishment of the 
      Hereafter is even severer and more lasting. <BR>128. Does it not furnish 
      guidance to them, how many a generation WE destroyed before them, amid 
      whose dwellings they now walk ? Therein, verily, are Signs for those who 
      possess understanding. <BR>129. And had not been for a word already gone 
      forth from thy Lord, and a term already fixed, their punishment would have 
      been abiding. <BR>130. Bear patiently then what they say, and glorify thy 
      Lord with HIS praise before the rising of the sun and before its setting; 
      and glorify HIM in the hours of the night and all parts of the day, that 
      thou mayest find true happiness. <BR>131. And strain not thine eyes after 
      what WE have bestowed on some classes of them of the splendour of the 
      present world that WE may try them thereby. And the provision of thy Lord 
      is better and more lasting. <BR>132. And enjoin Prayer on thy people and 
      be constant therein. WE ask thee not for provision; it is WE who provide 
      for thee. And the good end is for those who guard against evil. <BR>133. 
      And they say, `Why does he not bring us a Sign from his Lord ?' Has there 
      not come to them clear evidence of what is contained in the former Books ? 
      <BR>134. And if WE had destroyed them with a punishment before the coming 
      of this Messenger, they would have surely said, `Our Lord, wherefore didst 
      Thou not send to us a Messenger that we might have followed Thy 
      commandments before we were humbled and disgraced ?' <BR>135. Say, `Each 
      one is waiting; wait ye, therefore, and you will soon know who are the 
      people of the right path and who follow true guidance, and who do 
    not.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
