    <TD>70. They said, `Pray for us to thy Lord that HE make plain to us what 
      she is, for all such cows appear to us alike; and if ALLAH please, we 
      shall indeed be guided aright,' <BR>71. He answered, `God says it is a cow 
      not broken to plough the earth or water the tilth; one without blemish; of 
      one colour.' They said, `Now thou have brought the truth.' Then they 
      slaughtered her, though they would rather not do it. <BR>72. And remember 
      the time when you killed a person and differed among yourselves about it, 
      and ALLAH, would bring to light what you were hiding. <BR>73. Then WE 
      said, `Compare this incident with some other similar ones' and you will 
      discover the truth. Thus does ALLAH give life to the dead and show you HIS 
      Signs that you may understand.<BR>74. Then your hearts became hardened

      there are some out of which gush forth streams, and of them there are some 
      out of which flows water when they cleave asunder. And indeed of them are 
      some that humble themselves for the fear of ALLAH. And ALLAH is not 
      unmindful of what you do. <BR>75. Do you expect that they will believe you 
      when a party of them hear the Word of ALLAH, then pervert it after they 
      have understood it, and they well know the consequences thereof. <BR>76. 
      And when they meet those who believe, they say `We believe,' and when they 
      meet one another in private, they say, `Do you inform them (the believers) 
      of what ALLAH has unfolded to you, that they may thereby argue with you 
      before your Lord. Will you not then understand
