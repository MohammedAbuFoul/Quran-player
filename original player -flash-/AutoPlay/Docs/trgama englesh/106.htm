    <TD>176. They ask thee for a decision. Say, `ALLAH gives HIS decision 
      concerning `Kal?lah. If a man dies leaving no child and he has a sister, 
      then she shall have half of what he leaves; and he shall inherit her if 
      she has no child. But if there be two sisters, then they shall have 
      two-thirds of what he leaves. And if the heirs be brethren - both men and 
      women - then the male shall have as much as the portion of two females. 
      ALLAH explains this to you lest you go astray and ALLAH knows all things 
      well.' <BR>&nbsp;

      1. O ye who believe ! fulfill you compacts. Lawful are made to you 
      quadrupeds of the class of cattle other than those which are being 
      announced to you, except that you should not hold game to be lawful while 
      you are in a state of pilgrimage; verily, ALLAH decrees what HE wills. 
      <BR>2. O ye who believe ! profane not the Signs of ALLAH, nor the Sacred 
      Month, nor the animals brought as an offering, nor the animals of 
      sacrifice wearing collars nor those repairing to the Sacred House, seeking 
      grace from their Lord and HIS pleasure. And when you put off the pilgrims' 
      garb and are clear of the Sacred Territory, you may hunt. And let not the 
      enmity of a people, that they hindered you from the Sacred Mosque, incite 
      you to transgress. And help one another in righteousness and in piety; but 
      help not one another in sin and transgression. And fear ALLAH; Surely 
      ALLAH is Severe in 
punishment.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
