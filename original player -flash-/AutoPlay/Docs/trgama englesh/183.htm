    <TD>46. And obey ALLAH and HIS Messenger and dispute not with one another, 
      lest you falter and your strength depart from you. And be steadfast; 
      surely, ALLAH is with the steadfast. <BR>47. And be not like those who 
      came forth from their homes boastfully, and to be seen of men, and who 
      turn men away from the path of ALLAH, and ALLAH encompasses what they do. 
      <BR>48. And when Satan made their deeds seem fair to them and said, `None 
      from among men shall prevail against you this day, and I am your 
      protector.' But when the two armies came in sight of each other, he turned 
      on his heels, and said, `Surely, I have nothing to do with you; surely, I 
      see what you see not. surely I fear ALLAH; and ALLAH's punishment is 
      severe. <BR>49. When the Hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease 
      said, `Their religion has deluded these men.' And whoso puts his trust in 
      ALLAH, then surely, ALLAH is Mighty, Wise. <BR>50. And if thou couldst see 
      when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve, smiting their 
      faces and their backs and saying: `Taste ye the punishment of burning. 
      <BR>51. `This torment is because of that which your hands have sent on 
      before and know that ALLAH is not at all unjust to HIS servants.' <BR>52. 
      Your condition will be like that of the people of Pharaoh and those before 
      them, they disbelieved in the Signs of ALLAH; so ALLAH punished them for 
      their sins. Surely, ALLAH is Powerful and Severe in 
  punishing.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
