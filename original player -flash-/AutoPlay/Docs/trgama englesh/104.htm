    <TD>163. Surely, WE have sent revelation to thee, as WE sent revelation to 
      Noah and the Prophets after him; and WE sent revelation to Abraham and 
      Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and his children and to Jesus and Job and 
      Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and WE gave David a Book. <BR>164. And WE 
      sent some Messengers whom WE have already mentioned to thee and some 
      Messengers whom WE have not mentioned to thee - and to Moses ALLAH spoke 
      at great length - <BR>165. Messengers, bearers of glad tidings and 
      Warners, so that people may have no plea against ALLAH after the coming of 
      Messengers. And ALLAH is Mighty, Wise. <BR>166. But ALLAH bears witness by 
      means of the revelation which HE has sent down to thee, that HE has sent 
      it down full of HIS knowledge, and the angels also bear witness; and 
      sufficient is ALLAH as a Witness. <BR>167. Those who disbelieve and hinder 
      others from the way of ALLAH, have certainly strayed far away. <BR>168. 
      Surely, those who have disbelieved and have acted unjustly, ALLAH will not 
      forgive them, nor will HE show them any way. <BR>169. Except the way of 
      Hell, wherein they shall abide for a long, long period. And that is easy 
      for ALLAH. <BR>170. O mankind ! the Messenger has indeed come to you with 
      truth from your Lord; believe therefore, it will be better for you. But if 
      you disbelieve, verily, to ALLAH belongs whatever is in the heavens and in 
      the earth. And ALLAH is All-Knowing, 
Wise.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
