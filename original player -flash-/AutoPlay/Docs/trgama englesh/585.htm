    <TD>1. He frowned and turned aside, <BR>2. Because there came to him the 
      blind man; <BR>3. And what would make thee know that he would purify 
      himself, <BR>4. Or, that he would take heed and the taking of heed would 
      benefit him ? <BR>5. How could it be that he who is disdainfully 
      indifferent to the Truth, <BR>6. Unto him thou shouldst pay attention - 
      <BR>7. Though thou art not responsible if he does not become purified - 
      <BR>8. But he who comes to thee hastening, <BR>9. And he fears God, 
      <BR>10. Him shouldst thou neglect, <BR>11. That should not be ! Surely, it 
      is a Reminder - <BR>12. So let him who desires pay heed to it - <BR>13. 
      Contained in honoured Books, <BR>14. Exalted, purified, <BR>15. In the 
      hands of writers, <BR>16. Noble and virtuous. <BR>17. Woe unto man ! How 
      ungrateful he is ! <BR>18. Does he not consider, from what thing did God 
      create him ? <BR>19. From a sperm-drop ! HE creates him and proportions 
      him ? <BR>20. Then HE makes the way easy for him, <BR>21. Then in due 
      course HE causes him to die and assigns a grave to him; <BR>22. Then, when 
      HE pleases, HE will raise him up again. <BR>23. Nay ! he has not yet 
      carried out what God commanded him to do. <BR>24. Now let man look at his 
      food; <BR>25. How WE pour down water in abundance, <BR>26. Then WE cleave 
      the earth a proper cleaving, <BR>27. Then WE cause to grow therein grain, 
      <BR>28. And grapes and vegetables, <BR>29. And the olive and the 
      date-palm, <BR>30. And walled gardens thickly planted, <BR>31. And fruits 
      and herbage, <BR>32. A provision for you and your cattle. <BR>33. But when 
      the deafening shout comes, <BR>34. On the day when a man will flee from 
      his brother, <BR>35. And from his mother and his father, <BR>36. And from 
      his wife and his sons, <BR>37. Every man among them that day will have 
      concern enough of his own to make him indifferent to others. <BR>38. On 
      that day some faces will be bright, <BR>39. Laughing, joyous. <BR>40. And 
      some faces, on that day, will have dust upon them, <BR>41. Darkness 
      covering them. <BR>42. Those will be the disbelievers, the doers of 
    evil.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
