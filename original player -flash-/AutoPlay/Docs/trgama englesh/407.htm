    <TD>25. And of HIS Signs is that the heavens and the earth stand firm by 
      HIS command. Then when HE calls you by a single call to come forth from 
      the earth, behold, you will come <BR>26. And to HIM belongs whosoever is 
      in the heavens and the earth. All are obedient to HIM. <BR>27. And HE it 
      is Who originates the creation, then keeps repeating it, and it is most 
      easy for HIM. HIS is the most exalted state in the heavens and the earth; 
      and HE is the Mighty, the Wise. <BR>28. HE sets forth for you a parable 
      concerning yourselves. Have you, among those whom your right hands 
      possess, partners in what WE have provided for you so that you become 
      equal sharers therein, and you fear them as you fear each other ? Thus do 
      WE explain the Signs to a people who understand. <BR>29. Nay, but those, 
      who are unjust, follow their own low desires without knowledge. Then who 
      can guide him whom ALLAH lets go astray ? There will be no helpers for 
      them. <BR>30. So set thy face to the service of religion with 
      single-minded devotion. And follow the nature made by ALLAH, the nature 
      according to which HE has fashioned mankind. There is no altering the 
      creation of ALLAH. That is the right religion - but most men know not - 
      <BR>31. So you all turn to HIM, in repentance, and seek HIS protection and 
      observe Prayer, and be not of those who associate partners with ALLAH - 
      <BR>32. Of those who split up their religion and have become divided into 
      sects, every party rejoicing in what they 
have.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
