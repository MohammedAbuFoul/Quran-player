    <TD>97. And he whom ALLAH guides, is the only one rightly guided; but as 
      for those whom HE leaves to go astray, thou wilt find for them no helpers 
      beside HIM. And on the Day of Resurrection WE shall gather them together 
      on their faces blind, dumb and deaf. Their abode shall be Hell; every time 
      it abates, WE shall increase for them the flame. <BR>98. That is their 
      recompense, because they rejected Our Signs and said, `What ! when we die 
      and are reduced to bones and broken particles, shall we really be raised 
      up as a new creation ?' <BR>99. Do they not see that ALLAH, WHO created 
      the heavens and the earth, has the power to create the like of them ? And 
      HE has appointed for them a term; there is no doubt about it. But the 
      wrongdoers would reject everything but disbelief. <BR>100. Say, `Even if 
      you possessed the limitless treasures of the mercy of my Lord, you would 
      surely hold them back for the fear of exhausting them, for man is 
      niggardly.' <BR>101. And certainly WE gave Moses nine manifest Signs. So 
      ask then the Children of Israel. When he came to them, Pharaoh said to 
      him, `I do think thee, O Moses, to be a victim of deception.' <BR>102. He 
      said, `Thou thinkest well that none has sent down these Signs but the Lord 
      of the heavens and the earth as so many evidences; and I certainly 
      consider thee, O Pharaoh, to be doomed to perish.' <BR>103. So he resolved 
      to remove them from the land; but WE drowned him and those who were with 
      him, all together. <BR>104. And after him WE said to the Children of 
      Israel, Dwell ye in the promised land; and when the time of the promise of 
      the Latter Days comes, WE shall bring you together out of various 
      peoples.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
