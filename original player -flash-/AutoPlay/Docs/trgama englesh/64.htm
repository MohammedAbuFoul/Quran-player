    <TD>109. And to ALLAH belongs whatever is in the heavens and what ever is 
      in the earth, and to ALLAH shall all affairs be returned for decision. 
      <BR>110. You are the best people raised for the good of mankind; you 
      enjoin good and forbid evil and believe in ALLAH. And if the People of the 
      Book had believed, it would have, surely, been better for them. Some of 
      them are believers, but most of them are transgressors. <BR>111. They 
      cannot harm you save that they may cause you slight hurt; and if they 
      fight you, they will turn their backs to you. Then they shall not be 
      helped. <BR>112. They shall be smitten with abasement wherever they are 
      found unless they are protected by a covenant with ALLAH or by a covenant 
      with men. They have incurred the wrath of ALLAH, and they have been 
      smitten with wretchedness. That is because they rejected the Signs of 
      ALLAH and sought to slay the Prophets unjustly. That is because they 
      rebelled and used to transgress. <BR>113. They are not all alike. Among 
      the People of the Book, there is a party who stand by their covenant; they 
      recite the word of ALLAH in the hours of the night and prostrate 
      themselves before HIM. <BR>114. They believe in ALLAH and the Last Day, 
      and enjoin good and forbid evil, and hasten to vie with one another in 
      good works. And these are among the righteous. <BR>115. And whatever good 
      they do, they shall not be denied its due reward, and ALLAH well knows 
      those who guard against 
evil.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
