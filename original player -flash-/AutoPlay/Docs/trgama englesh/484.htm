    <TD>11. HE is the originator of the heavens and the earth. HE has made for 
      you pairs of you own selves, and of the cattle also HE has made pairs. HE 
      multiplies you therein. There is nothing whatever like unto HIM, and HE is 
      the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. <BR>12. To HIM belong the keys of the 
      heavens and the earth. HE enlarges the provision for whomsoever HE pleases 
      and straitens it for whomsoever HE pleases. Surely, HE knows all things 
      full well. <BR>13. HE has prescribed for you the religion which HE 
      enjoined on Noah, and which WE have now revealed to thee, and which WE 
      enjoined on Abraham and Moses and Jesus, viz., `Establish obedience to 
      ALLAH in the earth, and be not divided therein. Hard upon the idolaters is 
      that to which thou callest them. ALLAH chooses for Himself whom HE 
      pleases, and guides to Himself him who turns to HIM.' <BR>14. And they did 
      not become divided but, after knowledge had come to them, through jealousy 
      among themselves. And had it not been for a word that had already gone 
      forth from thy Lord for an appointed term, the matter would, surely, have 
      been decided between them. Surely, those who were made to inherit the Book 
      after them are in a disquieting doubt concerning it. <BR>15. To this 
      religion, then, do thou invite mankind. And be thou steadfast in it as 
      thou art commanded, and follow not their evil inclinations, but say, `I 
      believe in whatever book ALLAH has sent down, and I am commanded to judge 
      justly between you; ALLAH is our Lord and your Lord. For us is the reward 
      of our works, and for you the reward of your works. There is no quarrel 
      between us and you. ALLAH will gather us together, and to HIM is the 
      return.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
