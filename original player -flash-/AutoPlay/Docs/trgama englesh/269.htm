    <TD>15. And HE has placed in the earth firm mountains lest it quake with 
      you and rivers and routes that you may find the way to your destination. 
      <BR>16. And, HE has set up other marks; by them and by the stars they 
      follow the right direction. <BR>17. Is HE, then, WHO creates like one who 
      creates not ? Will you not then take heed ? <BR>18. And if you try to 
      count the favours of ALLAH, you will not be able to number them. Surely, 
      ALLAH is Most Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>19. And ALLAH knows what you keep 
      hidden and what you disclose. <BR>20. And those on whom they call besides 
      ALLAH create not anything, but they are themselves created. <BR>21. They 
      are dead, not living; and they know not when they will be raised. <BR>22. 
      Your God is One God. And as to those who believe not in the Hereafter, 
      their hearts are strangers to truth and they are full of pride. <BR>23. 
      Undoubtedly, ALLAH knows what they keep secret and what they disclose. 
      Surely, HE loves not the proud. <BR>24. And when it is said to them, `What 
      think ye of that which your Lord has sent down ?' They say, `They are but 
      mere stories of the ancients.' <BR>25. The consequence will be that they 
      shall bear their burdens in full on the Day of Resurrection, and also a 
      portion of the burdens of those whom they lead astray without knowledge. 
      Behold ! evil is that which the bear. <BR>26. Those who were before them 
      also devised plans, but ALLAH came upon their structure from the very 
      foundations, so that the roof fell down upon them from above them, and the 
      punishment came upon them from where they knew 
not.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
