    <TD>41. The guilty will be known by their marks, and they will be seized 
      by their forelocks and their feet. <BR>42. Which, then, of the favours of 
      your Lord will ye twain, deny ? <BR>43. And they will be told: `This is 
      the Hell which the guilty denied, <BR>44. `Between it and the fierce 
      boiling water will they go round.' <BR>45. Which, then, of the favours of 
      your Lord will ye twain, deny ? <BR>46. And for him who fears to stand 
      before his Lord there are two gardens - <BR>47. Which, then, of the 
      favours of your Lord will ye twain, deny ? <BR>48. Having many varieties 
      of trees. <BR>49. Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will ye twain, 
      deny ? <BR>50. In each of them there are two fountains flowing freely. 
      <BR>51. Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will ye twain, deny ? 
      <BR>52. Therein will be every kind of fruit in pairs. <BR>53. Which, then, 
      of the favours of your Lord will ye twain, deny ? <BR>54. The inmates 
      thereof will recline on couches over carpets, the linings of which will be 
      of thick brocade. And the fruit of the two Gardens will be within their 
      easy reach. <BR>55. Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will ye 
      twain, deny ? <BR>56. Therein will also be chaste maidens restraining 
      their glances, whom neither man nor jinn will have touched before them - 
      <BR>57. Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will ye twain, deny ? 
      <BR>58. As if they were rubies and small pearls; <BR>59. Which, then, of 
      the favours of your Lord will ye twain, deny ? <BR>60. Is the reward of 
      goodness anything but goodness ? <BR>61. Which, then, of the favours of 
      your Lord will ye twain, deny ? <BR>62. And besides these two, there are 
      two other gardens - <BR>63. Which, then, of the favours of your Lord will 
      ye twain, deny ? <BR>64. Dark green with foliage - <BR>65. Which, then, of 
      the favours of your Lord will ye twain, deny ? <BR>66. Therein also will 
      be two springs, gushing forth with water. <BR>67. Which, then, of the 
      favours of your Lord will ye twain, deny
