    <TD>13. And whether you conceal what you say or say it openly, HE knows 
      well all that which is in your breasts. <BR>14. Does HE, Who has created 
      you, not know it ? HE is the Knower of all subtleties, the All-Aware. 
      <BR>15. HE it is Who has made the earth even and smooth for you; so walk 
      in the spacious paths thereof, and eat of HIS provision. And unto HIM will 
      be the resurrection. <BR>16. Do you feel secure from HIM Who is in the 
      heaven that HE will not cause the earth to sink with you ? When lo ! it 
      begins to shake. <BR>17. Do you feel secure from HIM Who is in the heaven 
      that HE will not send against you a heavy sand-storm ? Then will you know 
      how terrible was MY Warning ! <BR>18. And, indeed, those before them also 
      rejected MY Messengers, then how grievous was MY punishment ! <BR>19. Do 
      they not see the birds above them, spreading out their wings in flight and 
      then drawing them in to swoop down upon the prey ? None withholds them but 
      the Gracious God, HE sees all things well. <BR>20. Can those, who are 
      counted your hosts, help you against the Gracious God ? The disbelievers 
      are only the victims of self-deception. <BR>21. Or, who is he that will 
      provide for you, if HE should withhold HIS provision ? Nay, but they 
      obstinately persist in rebellion and aversion. <BR>22. What ! is he who 
      walks groveling upon his face better guided, or he who walks upright on 
      the straight path ? <BR>23. Say, `HE it is Who brought you into being, and 
      made for you ears and eyes and hearts; but little thanks do you give.' 
      <BR>24. Say, `HE it is Who multiplied you in the earth, and unto HIM will 
      you all be gathered.' <BR>25. And they say, `When will this promise come 
      to pass, if, indeed, you are truthful ?' <BR>26. Say, `The knowledge of it 
      is with ALLAH, and I am but a plain 
Warner.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
