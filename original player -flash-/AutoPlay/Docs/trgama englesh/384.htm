    <TD>77. And verily it is a guidance and a mercy for the believers. <BR>78. 
      Verily, thy Lord will decide between them by HIS judgment, and HE is the 
      Mighty, the All-Knowing. <BR>79. So put thy trust in ALLAH, surely, thou 
      art on manifest truth. <BR>80. Verily, thou canst not make the dead to 
      hear, nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call, when they retreat 
      turning their backs. <BR>81. And thou canst not guide the blind out of 
      their error. Thou canst make only those to hear who believe in Our Signs, 
      so they submit. <BR>82. And when the sentence is passed against them, WE 
      shall bring forth for them an insect out of the earth which shall wound 
      them because people did not believe in Our Signs. <BR>83. And remind them 
      of the day when WE shall gather together from every people a party from 
      among those who rejected Our Signs, and they shall be formed into separate 
      groups. <BR>84. Till, when they come, HE will say, `Did you reject MY 
      Signs while you had not full knowledge concerning them ? Or, what was it 
      that you were doing about them ? <BR>85. And the sentence shall come to 
      pass against them because they did wrong, and they will be speechless. 
      <BR>86. See they not that WE have made the night that they may rest 
      therein, and the day sight-giving ? In that verily are Signs for a people 
      who believe. <BR>87. And call to mind the day when the trumpet will be 
      blown and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth will be 
      struck with terror, save him whom ALLAH pleases. And all shall come unto 
      HIM humbled. <BR>88. And thou seest the mountains, which thou thinkest to 
      be firmly fixed, pass away as the clouds pass away - the handiwork of 
      ALLAH Who has made everything perfect. Verily, HE is full Aware of what 
      you do.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
