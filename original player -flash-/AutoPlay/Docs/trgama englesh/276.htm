    <TD>80. And ALLAH has made for you, in your houses, a place of rest and 
      has also made for you, of the skins of cattle, abodes which you find light 
      at the time when you travel and useful at the time when you halt; and of 
      their wool and their furs and their hair HE has supplied you with 
      household goods and articles of use for a time. <BR>81. And ALLAH has made 
      for you of that which HE has created, many things affording shade; and HE 
      has made for you in the mountains places of shelter; and HE has made for 
      you garments which protect you from heat, and coats of mail which protect 
      you in your wars. Thus does HE complete HIS favours upon you, that you may 
      submit wholly to HIM. <BR>82. But if they turn away, then thou art 
      responsible only for the plain delivery of the Message. <BR>83. They 
      recognize the favour of ALLAH, yet they deny it; and most of them are 
      confirmed disbelievers. <BR>84. And remember the day when WE shall raise 
      up a witness from every people, then those who disbelieve shall not be 
      permitted to make amends, nor shall their plea be accepted. <BR>85. And 
      when those who did wrong actually see the punishment, it will not be 
      lightened for them, nor will they be respited. <BR>86. And when those who 
      associate partners with ALLAH, will see their associated-gods, they will 
      say, `Our Lord, these are our associated-gods, whom we used to call upon 
      instead of Thee.' Thereupon they will retort on them with the words, 
      `Surely, you are liars.' <BR>87. And they will offer submission to ALLAH 
      on that day, and all that they used to forge shall fail 
  them.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
