    <TD>7. And they carry your loads to a land which you could not reach 
      except with great hardship to yourselves. Surely, your Lord is 
      compassionate, Merciful. <BR>8. And HE has created horses and mules and 
      asses that you may ride them, and as a source of beauty. And HE will 
      create what you do not yet know. <BR>9. And upon ALLAH rests the showing 
      of the right way, and there are ways which deviate from the right course. 
      And if HE had enforced HIS Will, HE would have guided you all. <BR>10. HE 
      it is who sends down water from the clouds; out of it you have your drink, 
      and there grow from it trees on which you pasture your cattle. <BR>11. 
      Therewith HE grows corn for you and the olive and the date-palm and the 
      grapes and all manner of fruit. Surely, in that is a Sign for people who 
      reflect. <BR>12. And HE pressed into service for you the night and the day 
      and the sun and the moon; and the stars too have been pressed into service 
      by HIS command. Surely, in that are Signs for a people who use their 
      understanding. <BR>13. And the things of diverse hues that HE has created 
      for you in the earth also serve your purpose. Surely, in that is a Sign 
      for a people who take heed. <BR>14. And HE it is Who has subjected to you 
      the sea that you may eat therefrom fresh flesh and may take forth articles 
      which you wear as ornaments. And thou seest the ships ploughing through 
      it, that you may journey thereby and that you may seek of HIS bounty in 
      other ways and that you may be 
grateful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
