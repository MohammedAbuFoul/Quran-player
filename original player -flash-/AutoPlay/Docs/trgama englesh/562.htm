    <TD>1. Blessed is HE in Whose hand is the Kingdom, and HE has power over 
      all things; <BR>2. Who has created death and life that HE might try you 
      -which of you is best in deeds; and HE is the Mighty, the Most Forgiving ; 
      <BR>3. Who has created seven heavens in harmony. No incongruity canst thou 
      see in the creation of the Gracious God. Then look again. Seest thou any 
      flaw ? <BR>4. Aye, look again, and yet again, thy sight will only return 
      unto thee confused and fatigued, having seen no incongruity. <BR>5. And 
      verily, WE have adorned the lowest heaven with lamps, and WE have made 
      them the means of driving away satans, and WE have prepared for them the 
      punishment of the blazing Fire. <BR>6. And for those who disbelieve in 
      their Lord, is the punishment of Hell, and an evil resort it is. <BR>7. 
      When they are cast therein, they will hear it roaring as it boils up. 
      <BR>8. It would almost burst with fury. Whenever a host of wrongdoers is 
      cast into it the wardens thereof will ask them `Did no Warner come to you 
      ?' <BR>9. They will say, `Yea, indeed, a Warner did come to us, but we 
      treated him as a liar, and we said, `ALLAH has not revealed anything; you 
      are but in manifest error.' <BR>10. And they will say, `Had we but 
      listened or had sense, we should not have been among the inmates of the 
      blazing Fire.' <BR>11. Thus will they confess their sins; but far removed 
      from God's mercy are the inmates of the blazing Fire. <BR>12. Verily, 
      those who fear their Lord in secret - for them is forgiveness and a great 
      reward.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
