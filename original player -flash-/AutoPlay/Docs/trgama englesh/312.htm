    <TD>96. Those who believe and do good deeds - The Gracious God will create 
      deep love for them. <BR>97. So WE have made the Qur'an easy in thy tongue 
      that thou mayest give thereby glad tidings to the righteous, and warn 
      thereby a contentious people. <BR>98. And how many a generation have WE 
      destroyed before them ! Canst thou perceive a single one of them, or hear 
      even a whisper of them ? <BR>&nbsp;

      1. Ta Ha. <BR>2. We have not sent down the Qur'an to thee that thou 
      shouldst be distressed; <BR>3. But as a reminder to him who fears God; 
      <BR>4. And a revelation from HIM Who created the earth and the high 
      heavens. <BR>5. HE is the Gracious God Who has settled Himself firmly on 
      the throne. <BR>6. To HIM belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and 
      whatsoever is in the earth, and whatsoever is between them, and whatsoever 
      is beneath the moist sub-soil. <BR>7. And if thou speakest aloud, HE hears 
      it and also if thou speakest in a low voice, For HE knows the secret 
      thoughts of man and what is yet more hidden. <BR>8. ALLAH - there is no 
      god but HE. HIS are the most beautiful names. <BR>9. And has the story of 
      Moses come to thee ? <BR>10. When he saw a fire, and he said to his 
      family, `Tarry ye, I perceive a fire; perhaps I may bring you a brand 
      therefrom or find guidance at the fire. <BR>11. And when he came to it, he 
      was called by a voice, `O Moses, <BR>12. `Verily, I am thy Lord. So take 
      off thy shoes; for thou art in the sacred Valley of
