    <TD>53. And in the like manner have WE tried some of them by others, that 
      they may say, `Is it these whom ALLAH has favoured from among us ?' Does 
      not ALLAH know best those who are grateful ? <BR>54. And when those who 
      believe in OUR Signs come to thee, say; `Peace be unto you ! Your Lord has 
      taken it upon Himself to show mercy, so that whoso among you does evil in 
      ignorance and repents thereafter and reforms, then HE is Most Forgiving 
      and Merciful.' <BR>55. And thus do WE expound the Signs that the truth may 
      become manifest and that the way of the sinners may become clear. <BR>56. 
      Say, `I am forbidden to worship those on whom you call besides ALLAH.' 
      Say, `I will not follow your low desires. In that case, I shall have gone 
      astray and I shall not be of the rightly guided.' <BR>57. Say, `I take my 
      stand on a clear evidence from my Lord and you reject it. That which you 
      desire to be hastened is not in my power. The decision rest with ALLAH 
      alone. HE explains the truth and HE is the Best of Judges.' <BR>58. Say, 
      `If that which you desire to be hastened were in my power, surely the 
      matter would have been decided between me and you. And ALLAH knows best 
      the unjust.' <BR>59. And with HIM are the keys of the unseen; none knows 
      them but HE. And HE knows whatsoever is in the land and in the sea. And 
      there falls not a leaf but HE knows it; nor is there a grain in the deep 
      darkness of the earth, nor anything green or dry, but it is recorded in a 
      clear book.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
