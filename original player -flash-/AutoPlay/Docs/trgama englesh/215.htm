    <TD>54. And if every soul that does wrong possessed all that is in the 
      earth, it would surely offer to ransom itself therewith. And they will 
      conceal their remorse, when they see the punishment. And judgment shall be 
      passed between them with equity and they shall not be wronged. <BR>55. 
      Remember, to ALLAH surely belongs whatever is in the heavens and the 
      earth. Remember, that ALLAH's promise is surely true. But most of them 
      understand not. <BR>56. HE it is who gives life and causes death, and to 
      HIM shall you all be brought back. <BR>57. O mankind ! there indeed has 
      come to you an Exhortation from your Lord and a healing for whatever 
      disease there is in the hearts, and a guidance and a mercy to the 
      believers. <BR>58. Say, `All this is through the grace of ALLAH and 
      through HIS mercy; therein, therefore, let them rejoice. That is better 
      than what they hoard.' <BR>59. Say, `Have you ever considered that ALLAH 
      has sent down provision for you, then you make some of it unlawful and 
      some lawful ? Say, `Has ALLAH permitted you that, or do you invent lies 
      against ALLAH ?' <BR>60. What think those who invent lies against ALLAH of 
      the Day of Resurrection ? Surely, ALLAH is Gracious towards mankind, but 
      most of them are not thankful. <BR>61. And thou art not engaged in 
      anything, and thou recitest not from HIM any portion of the Qur'an, and 
      you do no work, but WE are Witness of you when you are engrossed therein. 
      And there is not hidden from thy Lord even an atom's weight in the earth 
      or in heaven. And there is nothing smaller than that or greater, but it is 
      recorded in a clear Book.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
