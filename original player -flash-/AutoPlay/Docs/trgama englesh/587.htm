    <TD>1. When the heaven is cleft asunder, <BR>2. And when the stars are 
      scattered, <BR>3. And when the oceans are made to flow forth and joined 
      together, <BR>4. And when the graves are laid open, <BR>5. Every soul 
      shall then know what it has sent forth and what it has kept back, <BR>6. O 
      man ! what has deceived thee concerning thy Gracious Lord. <BR>7. Who 
      created thee, then perfected thee, then proportioned thee aright ? <BR>8. 
      In whatever form HE pleased. HE fashioned thee. <BR>9. Nay, but you deny 
      the judgment. <BR>10. Surely, there are guardians over you, <BR>11. Noble 
      recorders, <BR>12. Who know all that you do. <BR>13. Verily, the virtuous 
      will be in bliss; <BR>14. And the wicked will be in Hell; <BR>15. They 
      will burn therein on the Day of Judgment; <BR>16. And they will not be 
      able to escape therefrom. <BR>17. And what should make thee know what the 
      Day of Judgment is ! <BR>18. Again, what should make thee know what the 
      Day of Judgment is ! <BR>19. The day when a soul shall have no power to do 
      aught for another soul ! And the command on that day will be ALLAH's.

      1. Woe unto those who give short measure; <BR>2. Those who, when they take 
      by measure from other people, take it full; <BR>3. But when they give by 
      measure to others or weigh to them, they give them less. <BR>4. Do not 
      such people know that they will be raised again <BR>5. To witness the 
      judgment of a mighty day ? <BR>6. The day when mankind will stand before 
      the Lord of the worlds.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
