    <TD>171. And when WE shook the mountain over them as though it were a 
      covering and they thought it was going to fall on them, WE said, `Hold 
      fast that which WE have given you and remember what is therein that you 
      may guard against evil.' <BR>172. And remember when thy Lord brought forth 
      from Adam's children - out of their loins - their offspring and made them 
      to bear witness against their ownselves saying, `Yea, we do bear witness.' 
      This HE did lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, `We were 
      surely unaware of this.' <BR>173. Or lest you should say, `It was only our 
      fathers who associated co-partners with ALLAH in the past and we were 
      merely a generation after them. Wilt Thou then destroy us for what those, 
      who lied, did ? <BR>174. And thus do WE make clear the Signs, that they 
      may be admonished and that they may return to good. <BR>175. And relate to 
      them the story of him to whom WE gave OUR Signs, but he stepped away from 
      them; so Satan followed him up and he became one of those who go astray. 
      <BR>176. And if WE pleased, WE would have exalted him thereby; but he 
      inclined to the earth and followed his evil desires. His case, therefore, 
      is like the case of a thirsty dog; if thou drive him away, he hangs out 
      his tongue and if thou leave him, he hangs out his tongue. Such is the 
      case of the people who disbelieve in Our Signs. So relate to them this 
      narrative that they may reflect.' <BR>177. Evil is the case of the people 
      who treat Our Signs as lies. And it was their ownselves that they wronged. 
      <BR>178. He whom ALLAH guides, is on the right path. And they whom HE 
      leaves in error, these it is who shall be the 
losers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
