    <TD>70. O Prophet, say to the captives who are in your hands, `If ALLAH 
      knows any good in your hearts, HE will give you better than that which has 
      been taken from you as ransom and will forgive you. And ALLAH is Most 
      Forgiving, Merciful.' <BR>71. And if they intend to deal treacherously 
      with thee, they have indeed been treacherous to ALLAH before, But HE gave 
      thee power over them. And ALLAH is All-Knowing, Wise. <BR>72. Surely, 
      those who believed and left their homes and strove with their wealth and 
      their lives for the cause of ALLAH, and those who gave them shelter and 
      help - these are friends one of another. But as for those who believed but 
      did not leave their homes, you are not at all responsible for their 
      protection until they leave their homes. But if they seek your help in the 
      matter of religion, then it is your duty to help them, except against a 
      people between whom and yourselves there is a treaty. And ALLAH sees what 
      you do. <BR>73. And those who disbelieve - they are friends one of 
      another. If you do not what you are commanded, there will be mischief in 
      the land and great disorder. <BR>74. And those who believed and left their 
      homes and strove for the cause of ALLAH, and those who gave them shelter 
      and help -these indeed are true believers. For them is forgiveness and an 
      honourable provision. <BR>75. And those who believe after this and leave 
      their homes and strive for the cause of ALLAH along with you - these are 
      of you; and as to blood relations, they are nearer one to another in the 
      Book of ALLAH. Surely, ALLAH knows all things 
well.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
