    <TD>30. As for those who say, `Our Lord is ALLAH;' and then remain 
      steadfast, the angels descend on them, reassuring them: `Fear not, nor 
      grieve; and rejoice in the glad tidings of the Garden which you were 
      promised; <BR>31. `We are your friends in this life and in the Hereafter. 
      Therein you will have all that your souls will desire, and therein you 
      will have all that you will ask for - <BR>32. `An entertainment from the 
      Most Forgiving, Merciful God.' <BR>33. And who is better in speech than he 
      who invites men to ALLAH and does righteous deeds and says, `I am, surely, 
      of those who submit ?' <BR>34. And good and evil are not alike. Repel evil 
      with that which is best. And lo, he, between whom and thyself was enmity, 
      will become as though he were a warm friend. <BR>35. But none is granted 
      it save those who are steadfast; and none is granted it save those who 
      possess a large share of good. <BR>36. And if an incitement from Satan 
      incite thee, then seek refuge in ALLAH. Surely, HE is the All-Hearing, the 
      All-Knowing. <BR>37. And of HIS Signs are the night and the day and the 
      sun and the moon. Prostrate not yourselves before the sun, nor before the 
      moon, but prostrate yourselves before ALLAH, Who created them, if it is 
      HIM Whom you really worship. <BR>38. But if they turn away with disdain, 
      they do it to their own detriment, while those who are with thy Lord 
      glorify HIM night and day, and they are never 
wearied.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
