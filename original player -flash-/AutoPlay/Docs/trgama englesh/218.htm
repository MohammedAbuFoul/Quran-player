    <TD>79. And Pharaoh said, `Bring to me every expert sorcerer.' <BR>80. And 
      when the sorcerers came, Moses said to them, cast ye what you would cast.' 
      <BR>81. And when they had cast, Moses said, `What you have brought is mere 
      sorcery. Surely ALLAH will bring it to naught. Verily, ALLAH does not 
      permit the work of mischief-makers to prosper. <BR>82. `And ALLAH 
      establishes the truth by HIS words, even though the guilty be averse to 
      it.' <BR>83. And none obeyed Moses save some youths from among his people, 
      because of the fear of pharaoh and their chiefs, lest he should persecute 
      them. And surely Pharaoh was a tyrant in the land and surely he was of the 
      transgressors. <BR>84. And Moses said, `O my people, if you have believed 
      in ALLAH, then in HIM put your trust, if you have truly submitted to His 
      Will.' <BR>85. And they said, `In ALLAH do we put our trust. Our Lord, 
      make us not a trial for the wrongdoing people; <BR>86. `And deliver us by 
      Thy mercy from the tyranny of the disbelieving people.' <BR>87. And WE 
      revealed to Moses and his brother, saying, `Take for your people some 
      houses in the town, and construct your houses so that they face each other 
      and observe Prayer. And give glad tidings to the believers.' <BR>88. And 
      Moses said, `Our Lord, Thou hast bestowed upon Pharaoh and his chiefs 
      splendour and riches in the present life, with the result, our Lord, that 
      they are leading men astray from Thy path. Our Lord ! destroy their riches 
      and harden their hearts so that they believe not until they see the 
      grievous punishment.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
