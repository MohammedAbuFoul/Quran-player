    <TD>36. And when the disbelievers see thee, thy only make a jest of thee, 
      and say, `Is this the one who speaks ill of your gods ?' Yet it is they 
      themselves who deny all mention of the Gracious God. <BR>37. Man is 
      created of haste. I will certainly show you MY Signs, but ask ME not to 
      hasten. <BR>38. And they say, `When will this promise be fulfilled, if you 
      are truthful ?' <BR>39. If only the disbelievers knew the time when they 
      will not be able to ward off the fire from their faces, nor from their 
      backs, and they will not be helped. <BR>40. Nay, it will come upon them 
      unawares so that it will utterly confound them; and they will not be able 
      to repel it, nor will they be granted respite. <BR>41. And the Messengers 
      have indeed been mocked at before thee, but whereat they mocked 
      encompassed those of them who scoffed. <BR>42. Say, `Who can protect you 
      by night and by day from the Gracious God ?' Yet they turn away from the 
      remembrance of their Lord. <BR>43. Have they any gods that can protect 
      them against US ? They cannot help themselves, nor can they be befriended 
      by anyone against US. <BR>44. Nay, WE provided those and their fathers 
      with the good things of this world till life grew long for them. Do they 
      not see that WE are visiting the land, reducing it from its outlying 
      borders ? Can they even then be the victors 
?&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
