    <TD>94. They will make excuses to you when you return to them. Say, `Make 
      no excuses; we shall not believe you. ALLAH has already informed us of the 
      true facts about you. And ALLAH will observe your conduct, and also HIS 
      Messenger; then will you be brought back to HIM Who knows the unseen and 
      the seen, and HE will tell you all that you used to do.' <BR>95. They will 
      swear to you by ALLAH, when you return to them, that you may leave them 
      alone. So leave them alone. Surely, they are an abomination, and their 
      abode is Hell - a fit recompense for that which they used to do. <BR>96. 
      They will swear to you that you may be pleased with them. But even if you 
      be pleased with them, ALLAH will not be pleased with the rebellious 
      people. <BR>97. The Arabs of the desert are the worst in disbelief and 
      hypocrisy, and most apt not to know the ordinances of the Revelation which 
      ALLAH has sent down to HIS Messenger. And ALLAH is All-Knowing, Wise. 
      <BR>98. And among the Arabs of the desert are those who regard that which 
      they spend in the cause of ALLAH as a compulsory fine and they wait for 
      calamities to befall you. On themselves shall fall an evil calamity. And 
      ALLAH is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. <BR>99. And among the Arabs of the 
      desert are those who believe in ALLAH and the Last Day, and regard that 
      which they spend as means of bringing them near to ALLAH and of receiving 
      the prayers of the Prophet. Aye ! it is for them certainly a means of 
      bringing them near to ALLAH. ALLAH will soon admit them to HIS mercy. 
      Surely, ALLAH is Most Forgiving, 
Merciful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
