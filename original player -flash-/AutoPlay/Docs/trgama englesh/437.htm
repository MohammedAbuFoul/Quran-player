    <TD>19. The blind and the seeing are not alike. <BR>20. Nor the darkness 
      and the light, <BR>21. Nor the shade and the heat, <BR>22. Nor alike are 
      the living and the dead. Surely, ALLAH causes him to hear whom HE pleases; 
      and thou canst not make those hear who are in the graves. <BR>23. Thou art 
      only a warner. <BR>24. Verily, WE have sent thee with the Truth, as a 
      bearer of glad tidings and as a Warner; and there is no people to whom a 
      Warner has not been sent. <BR>25. And if they treat thee as a liar, those 
      who were before them also treated their Messengers as liars. Their 
      Messengers came to them with clear Signs, and with the Scriptures, and 
      with the illuminating Book. <BR>26. Then I seized those who disbelieved, 
      and how terrible were the consequences of denying ME ! <BR>27. Dost thou 
      not see that ALLAH sends down water from the sky, and WE bring forth 
      therewith fruits of different colours; and in the mountains are streaks 
      white and red, of diverse hues, and others raven black ? <BR>28. And in 
      the like manner, there are men and beasts and cattle, of various colours. 
      Only those of HIS servants who are endowed with knowledge fear ALLAH. 
      Verily, ALLAH is Mighty, Most forgiving. <BR>29. Surely, only those who 
      follow the Book of ALLAH and observe Prayer and spend out of what WE have 
      provided for them, secretly and in public, look for a bargain which will 
      never fail; <BR>30. In order that HE may give them their full rewards, and 
      even increase them out of HIS bounty. HE is, surely, Most Forgiving, Most 
      Appreciating.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
