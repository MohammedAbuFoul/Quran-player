    <TD>144. ALLAH said, `O Moses, I have chosen thee above the people of thy 
      time by MY Messages and by MY Word. So take firm hold of that which I have 
      given thee and be of the grateful.' <BR>145. And WE wrote for him upon the 
      Tablets about everything an admonition and an explanation of all things. 
      `So hold them fast and bid thy people follow the best thereof. Soon shall 
      I show you the abode of the transgressors.' <BR>146. I shall soon turn 
      away from MY Signs those who behave proudly in the land in an unjust 
      manner; and even if they see all the Signs, they will not believe therein; 
      and if they see the way of righteousness, they will not adopt it as their 
      way; but if they see the way of error, they will adopt it as their way. 
      That is because they treated Our Signs as lies and were heedless of them. 
      <BR>147. And those who reject Our Signs and the meeting of the Hereafter - 
      their works are vain. Can they expect to be rewarded for anything except 
      for what they do ? <BR>148. And the people of Moses made, in his absence, 
      out of their ornaments, a calf - a lifeless body, producing a lowing 
      sound. Did they not see that it spoke not to them, nor guided them to any 
      way ? They took it for worship and they were transgressors. <BR>149. And 
      when they were smitten with remorse and saw that they had indeed gone 
      astray, they said, `If our Lord have not mercy on us and forgive us, we 
      shall surely be of the 
losers.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
