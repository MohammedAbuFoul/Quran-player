    <TD>106. And ask forgiveness of ALLAH. Surely, ALLAH is Most Forgiving, 
      Merciful. <BR>107. And plead not on behalf of those who are dishonest to 
      themselves. Surely, ALLAH loves not one who is perfidious and a great 
      sinner. <BR>108. They seek to hide their designs from men, but they cannot 
      hide them from ALLAH; and HE is present with them when they plot at night 
      about matters which HE does not approve. And ALLAH encompasses what they 
      do. <BR>109. Behold ! you are those who pleaded for them in the present 
      life. But who will plead with ALLAH for them on the Day of Resurrection, 
      or who will be a guardian over them ? <BR>110. And whoso does evil or 
      wrongs his soul, and then asks forgiveness of ALLAH, will find ALLAH Most 
      Forgiving, Merciful. <BR>111. And whoso commits a sin, it is only against 
      his own soul. And ALLAH is All-Knowing, Wise. <BR>112. And whoso commits a 
      fault or a sin, then throws the blame thereof on an innocent person, 
      certainly bears the burden of calumny and a manifest sin. <BR>113. And but 
      for the grace of ALLAH upon thee and HIS mercy, a party of them had 
      resolved to bring about thy ruin. And they ruin none but themselves and 
      they cannot harm thee at all. And ALLAH has sent down to thee the Book and 
      wisdom and has taught thee what thou knewest not, and great is ALLAH's 
      grace on thee.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
