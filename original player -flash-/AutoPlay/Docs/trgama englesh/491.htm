    <TD>23. Even so WE never sent any Warner before thee to any township, but 
      the wealthy ones among them said, `We found our fathers following a 
      certain course, and we are following in their footsteps.' <BR>24. Their 
      Messenger said, `What ! even though I bring you a better guidance than 
      that which you found your fathers following ?' They said, `Certainly we 
      disbelieve in that which you are sent with.' <BR>25. So WE exacted 
      retribution from them. Then see what was the end of those who rejected the 
      Prophets ! <BR>26. And call to mind when Abraham said to his father, and 
      his people, `I do, indeed, disown what you worship, <BR>27. `Except HIM 
      Who created me, and HE will, surely, guide me.' <BR>28. And he left this 
      as a permanent legacy among his posterity, that they might turn to God. 
      <BR>29. Nay, but I bestowed upon these disbelievers and their fathers 
      worldly provision until there comes to them the truth and a Messenger who 
      makes his Message clear. <BR>30. But when the truth came to them they 
      said, `This is sorcery and we do reject it.' <BR>31. And they say, `Why 
      has not the Qur'an been sent to some great man of the two towns ?' <BR>32. 
      Are they then the distributors of the mercy of thy Lord ? It is WE Who 
      distribute among them their livelihood in the present life, and WE exalt 
      some of them above others in degrees of rank, so that some of them may 
      make others subservient to themselves. And the mercy of thy Lord is better 
      than that which they amass. <BR>33. And were it not that all mankind would 
      have become one type of people, WE would have given to those who 
      disbelieve in the Gracious God roofs of silver for their houses, and 
      silver stairways by which they could 
ascend;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
