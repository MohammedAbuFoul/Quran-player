    <TD>38. Then and there did Zachariah pray to his Lord, saying, `My Lord 
      grant me from Thyself pure offspring; surely thou art the Hearer of 
      Prayer.' <BR>39. And the angels called to him as he stood praying in the 
      chamber, `ALLAH gives thee glad tidings of Yahya, who shall testify to the 
      truth of a word from ALLAH - noble and chaste and a Prophet, from among 
      the righteous. <BR>40. He said `My Lord, how shall I have a son, when old 
      age has overtaken me already, and my wife is barren ?' He answered, `Such 
      is the way of ALLAH; HE does what HE pleases,' <BR>41. He said `My Lord, 
      give me a commandment.' He replied, `The commandment for thee is that thou 
      shalt not speak to men for three days except by signs. And remember thy 
      Lord much and glorify HIM in the evening and in the early morning.' 
      <BR>42. And remember when the angels said, `ALLAH has chosen thee and 
      purified thee and chosen thee above all women of the time. <BR>43. `O 
      Mary, be obedient to thy Lord and prostrate thyself and worship the one 
      God with those who worship HIM.' <BR>44. This is of the tidings of things 
      unseen which WE reveal to thee. And thou was not with them when they cast 
      their arrows, as to which of them should be the guardian of Mary, nor was 
      thou with them when they disputed with one another.<BR>45. When the angels 
      said, `O Mary, ALLAH gives thee glad tidings of a son through a word from 
      HIM; his name shall be the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, honoured in this 
      world and in the next, and of those who are granted nearness to 
    God;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
