    <TD>24. And they will be guided to pure speech, and they will be guided to 
      the path of the Praiseworthy God. <BR>25. As to those who disbelieve and 
      hinder men from the way of ALLAH and from the Sacred Mosque, which WE have 
      appointed equally for the benefit of all men, be they dwellers therein or 
      visitors from the desert, and whoso seeks wrongfully to deviate therein 
      from the right path - WE shall cause him to taste of a grievous 
      punishment. <BR>26. And call to mind when WE assigned to Abraham the site 
      of the House and said, `Associate not anything with ME and keep MY House 
      clean for those who perform the circuits, and those who stand up and those 
      who bow and prostrate themselves in Prayer; <BR>27. And proclaim unto men 
      the Pilgrimage. They will come to thee on foot, and on every lean camel, 
      coming by every distant, deep, track. <BR>28. `That they may witness the 
      benefits provided for them and may mention the name of ALLAH, during the 
      appointed days, over the quadrupeds of the class of cattle that HE has 
      provided for them. So eat thereof and feed the distressed and the needy. 
      <BR>29. `Then let them accomplish their needful acts of cleansing, and 
      fulfill their vows, and go around the Ancient House.' <BR>30. That is 
      ALLAH's commandment. And whoso honours the things declared sacred by 
      ALLAH, it will be good for him with his Lord. And the eating of the flesh 
      of all cattle is made lawful to you except that which has already been 
      announced to you in the Qur'an. Shun, therefore, the abomination of idols, 
      and shun all words of untruth,</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
