    <TD>29. `And O my people, I do not ask of you any wealth in return for it. 
      My reward is only with ALLAH. And I am not going to drive away those who 
      believe. They shall certainly meet their Lord. But I see that you are an 
      ignorant people; <BR>30. `And O my people, who would help me against 
      ALLAH, If I were to drive them away ? Will you not then take heed ? 
      <BR>31. `And I do not say to you, I possess the treasures of ALLAH nor do 
      I know the unseen,' nor do I say, `I am an angel.' Nor do I say concerning 
      those whom your eyes despise, `ALLAH will not bestow any good on them' - 
      ALLAH knows best what is in their minds. Surely, in that case I should be 
      of the unjust.' <BR>32. They said, `O Noah, thou hast indeed disputed with 
      us and disputed long and often; bring us now what thou threatenest us 
      with, if thou art of the truthful.' <BR>33. He said, `ALLAH alone will 
      bring it to you, if HE please, and you cannot frustrate HIS purpose; 
      <BR>34. `And my advice will profit you not even if I seek to give you 
      sincere advice if ALLAH intends to destroy you. HE is your Lord and to HIM 
      shall you be made to return.' <BR>35. Do they say, `He has forged it ?' 
      Say, `If I have forged it, on be my guilt and I am clear of all the crimes 
      you commit.' <BR>36. And it was revealed to Noah: `None of thy people will 
      believe except those who have already believed; grieve not, therefore, at 
      what they have been doing. <BR>37. And build thou the Ark under Our eyes 
      and as commanded by Our revelation. And address ME not concerning the 
      wrongdoers. They are surely going to be 
drowned.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
