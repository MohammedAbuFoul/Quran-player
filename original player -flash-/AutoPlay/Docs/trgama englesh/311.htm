    <TD>77. Hast thou not seen him who disbelieves in OUR Signs, and says, `I 
      shall certainly be given great wealth and children ?' <BR>78. Has he got 
      knowledge of the unseen or has he taken a promise from the Gracious God ? 
      <BR>79. Indeed not ! WE shall note down what he says and shall prolong for 
      him the punishment. <BR>80. And WE shall inherit from him all that he 
      talks of and he shall come to US all alone. <BR>81. And they have taken 
      other gods than ALLAH that they may be a source of honour and power for 
      them. <BR>82. Not at all ! They will deny their worship, and will be their 
      opponents. <BR>83. Seest thou not that WE send satans against the 
      disbelievers, inciting them to acts of disobedience ? <BR>84. So be thou 
      not in haste against them; WE are keeping full account of their doings. 
      <BR>85. Remember the day when WE shall gather the righteous before the 
      Gracious God as honoured guest; <BR>86. And WE shall drive the guilty to 
      Hell like a herd of thirsty camels. <BR>87. None will have the power of 
      intercession save he who has received a promise from the Gracious God. 
      <BR>88. And they say, `The Gracious God has taken unto Himself a son.' 
      <BR>89. Assuredly, you have indeed uttered a most hideous thing. <BR>90. 
      The heavens might well-nigh burst thereat, and the earth cleave asunder, 
      and the mountains fall down in pieces. <BR>91. Because they ascribe a son 
      to the Gracious God. <BR>92. It becomes not the Gracious God that HE 
      should take unto Himself a son. <BR>93. There is none in the heavens and 
      the earth but he shall come to the Gracious God as a bondman. <BR>94. 
      Verily, HE comprehends them by HIS knowledge and has numbered them all 
      fully. <BR>95. And each of them shall come to HIM on the Day of 
      Resurrection, all 
alone.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
