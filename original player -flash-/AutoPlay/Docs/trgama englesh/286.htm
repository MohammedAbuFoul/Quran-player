    <TD>39. These injunctions are part of that wisdom which thy Lord has 
      revealed to thee. And set not up with ALLAH any other god, lest thou be 
      cast into Hell, condemned and rejected. <BR>40. What ! has your Lord 
      favoured you with sons and taken for Himself females from among the angels 
      ? Surely, you say a grievous saying. <BR>41. WE have explained the truth 
      in this Qur'an in various ways that they may be admonished, but it only 
      increase them in aversion. <BR>42. Say, `Had there been other gods with 
      HIM as they allege, then certainly by their help the idolaters would have 
      sought out a way to the Owner of the Throne.' <BR>43. Holy is HE, and 
      Exalted far above that which they say. <BR>44. The seven heavens and the 
      earth and those that are therein extol HIS glory; and there is not a thing 
      but glorifies HIM with HIS praise; but you understand not their 
      glorification. Verily, HE is Forbearing, Most Merciful. <BR>45. And when 
      thou recitest the Qur'an, WE put between thee and those who believe not in 
      the Hereafter an invisible veil; <BR>46. And WE put coverings over their 
      hearts lest they should understand it, and in their ears a deafness. And 
      when thou makest mention in the Qur'an of thy Lord alone, they turn their 
      backs in aversion. <BR>47. WE knowest best what they listen for, when they 
      listen to thee, and when they confer in private, when the wrongdoers say, 
      `You follow none but a man who is a victim of deception.' <BR>48. See, how 
      they coin similitudes for thee, and have in consequence gone astray so 
      that they cannot find a way. <BR>49. And they say, `What ! when we shall 
      have become bones and broken particles, shall we be really raised up again 
      as a new creation ?'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
