    <TD>15. And when Our clear Signs are recited unto them, those who hope not 
      for the meeting with Us say, `Bring a Qur'an other than this or change 
      it.' Say, `It is not for me to change it of my own accord. I only follow 
      what is revealed to me. Indeed, I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the 
      punishment of an awful day.'' <BR>16. Say, `If ALLAH had so willed, I 
      should not have recited it to you, nor would I have made it known to you. 
      I have indeed lived a whole lifetime before this. Will you not then 
      understand ? <BR>17. Who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against 
      ALLAH or he who treats His Signs as lies ? Surely, the guilty shall never 
      prosper. <BR>18. And they worship, instead of ALLAH, that which neither 
      harms them nor profits them; and they say,`These are our intercessors with 
      ALLAH. Say, `Do you presume to inform ALLAH what HE knows not in the 
      heavens or in the earth ? Glory be to HIM ! High be HE exalted above all 
      that which they associate with HIM. <BR>19. And mankind were but one 
      community, then they differed among themselves; and had it not been for a 
      word that had gone before from thy Lord, it would have already been 
      decided between them concerning that in which they differed. <BR>20. And 
      they say, `Why has not a Sign been sent down to him from his Lord ? Say, 
      `The knowledge of the unseen belongs only to ALLAH. So wait. I am with you 
      among those who wait ?'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
