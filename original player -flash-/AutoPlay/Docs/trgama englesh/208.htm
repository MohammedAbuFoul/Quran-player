    <TD>1. Alif Lam Ra. These are the verses of the Book, full of wisdom. 
      <BR>2. It is a matter of wonder for men that WE have sent down revelation 
      to a man from among them, saying, `Warn mankind and give glad tidings to 
      those who believe that they have a true rank of honour with their Lord ?' 
      The disbelievers say, `Surely, this is a manifest sorcerer.' <BR>3. 
      Verily, your Lord is ALLAH WHO created the heavens and the earth in six 
      periods, then HE settled HIMSELF firmly on the Throne; HE governs 
      everything. There is no intercessors with HIM save after HIS permission. 
      This is ALLAH, your Lord, so worship HIM. Will you not, then, mind ? 
      <BR>4. To HIM shall you all return. The promise of ALLAH is true. Surely, 
      HE originates the creation; then HE reproduces it, that HE may reward 
      those who believe and do good works, with equity; and as for those who 
      disbelieve, they shall have boiling water to drink and a painful 
      punishment, because they disbelieved. <BR>5. HE it is WHO made the sun 
      radiate a brilliant light and the moon reflect a lustre, and ordained for 
      it proper stages, that you might know the count of years and the reckoning 
      of time. ALLAH has not created this system but in accordance with the 
      requirements of truth. HE details the signs for a people who possess 
      knowledge. <BR>6. Verily, in the alternation of night and day, and in all 
      that ALLAH has created in the heavens and the earth there are signs for a 
      God fearing people.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
