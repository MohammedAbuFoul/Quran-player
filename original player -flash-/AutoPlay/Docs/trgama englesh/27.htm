    <TD>177. It is not righteousness that you turn your faces to the East or 
      the West, but truly righteous is he who believes in ALLAH and the Last Day 
      and the angels and the Book and the Prophets, and spends his money out of 
      love for HIM, on the kindred and the orphans and the needy and the 
      wayfarer and those who ask for charity and for ransoming the captives; and 
      observes prayer and pays the Zak&#1604;t; and those who fulfill their promise 
      when they have made one, and the patient in poverty and afflictions and 
      the steadfast in the time of war; it is these who have proved truthful and 
      it is these who are truly God-Fearing. <BR>178. O ye who believe ! 
      equitable retaliation in the matter of the slain is prescribed for you; 
      the free man for the free man, and the slave for the slave, and the female 
      for the female. But for him who is granted any remission by his injured 
      brother, pursuing the matter for the realization of the blood-money shall 
      be done with fairness, and the murderer shall pay him the blood-money in a 
      handsome manner. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. And 
      whoso transgresses thereafter, for him there shall be a grievous 
      punishment. <BR>179. And there is life for you in the law of retaliation, 
      O men of understanding, that you may enjoy security. <BR>180. It is 
      prescribed for you, when death comes to any one of you, if he leaves much 
      wealth that he make a will to parents and near relatives to act with 
      fairness. This is an obligation on those who fear ALLAH.<BR>181. And he 
      who alters it after he has heard it , the sin thereof shall surely lie on 
      those who alter it. Surely ALLAH is All-Hearing and 
  All-Knowing.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
