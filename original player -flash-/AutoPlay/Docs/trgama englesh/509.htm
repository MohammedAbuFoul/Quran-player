          <TD>20. And those who believe say, `Why is not a Surah revealed ?' 
            But when a decisive Surah is revealed and fighting is mentioned 
            therein, thou seest those in whose hearts is a disease, looking 
            towards thee like the look of one who is fainting on account of 
            approaching death. So woe to them ! <BR>21. Their attitude should 
            have been one of obedience and of calling people to good. And when 
            the matter was determined upon, it was good for them if they were 
            true to ALLAH. <BR>22. Would you not then, if you are placed in 
            authority, create disorder in the land and sever your ties of 
            kinship ? <BR>23. It is these whom ALLAH has cursed, so that HE has 
            made them deaf and has made their eyes blind. <BR>24. Will they not, 
            then, ponder over the Qur'an, or, is it that there are locks on 
            their hearts ? <BR>25. Surely, those who turn their backs after 
            guidance has become manifest to them, Satan has seduced them and 
            holds out false hopes to them. <BR>26. That is because they said to 
            those who hate what ALLAH has revealed, `We will obey you in some 
            matters, and ALLAH knows their secrets. <BR>27. But how will they 
            fare when the angels will cause them to die, smiting their faces and 
            their backs ? <BR>28. That is because they followed that which 
            displeased ALLAH, and disliked the seeking of HIS pleasure. So HE 
            rendered their works vain. <BR>29. Do those in whose hearts is a 
            disease suppose that ALLAH will not bring to light their malice 
          ?&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
