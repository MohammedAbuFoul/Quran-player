    <TD>52. `Who used to say, `Art thou, indeed, among those who believe the 
      Resurrection to be true ? <BR>53. `When we are dead, and have become dust 
      and broken bones, shall we indeed, be requited ?' <BR>54. The speaker will 
      then ask those around him, `Will you have a look and find out about him ?' 
      <BR>55. Then he will look himself and see him in the midst of the Fire, 
      <BR>56. And will say to him, `By ALLAH, thou hadst almost caused my ruin, 
      <BR>57. But for the grace of my Lord, I should, surely, have been of those 
      who are called up before Hell; <BR>58. `Tell me, is it not so that we are 
      not going to suffer death again ? <BR>59. `Save our first death, and that 
      we are not to be punished ? <BR>60. Surely, this is the supreme triumph.' 
      <BR>61. For the like of this, then, let the workers work. <BR>62. Is that 
      better as an entertainment, of the tree of Zaqqum ?' <BR>63. Verily, WE 
      have made it a trial for the wrongdoers. <BR>64. It is a tree that springs 
      forth in the bottom of Hell; <BR>65. The fruit thereof is as though it 
      were the heads of serpents. <BR>66. And they shall eat of it and fill 
      their bellies therewith. <BR>67. Then will they have in addition to it a 
      mixture of boiling water to drink. <BR>68. Then, surely, their return 
      shall be Hell. <BR>69. They found their fathers erring. <BR>70. And they 
      hurried on in their footsteps. <BR>71. And most of the ancient peoples had 
      erred before them. <BR>72. And WE had sent Warners among them. <BR>73. 
      Behold, then, how evil was the end of those who were warned, <BR>74. Save 
      the chosen servants of ALLAH. <BR>75. And Noah, indeed, did cry unto US, 
      and how excellent Answerer of Prayers are WE ! <BR>76. And WE saved him 
      and his family from the great 
distress;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
