    <TD>154. What is the matter with you ? How judge ye ? <BR>155. Will you 
      not take heed ? <BR>156. Or, have you a clear authority ? <BR>157. Then 
      produce your book, if you are truthful. <BR>158. And they assert a kinship 
      between HIM and the jinn while the jinn themselves know well that they 
      will be brought before ALLAH for judgment. <BR>159. Holy is ALLAH and free 
      from what they attribute to HIM ! <BR>160. But the chosen servants of 
      ALLAH do not attribute anything derogatory to HIM. <BR>161. Verily, you 
      and what you worship - <BR>162. None of you can mislead anyone against 
      HIM, <BR>163. Except only him who shall burn in Hell. <BR>164. They say, 
      `There is not one of us but has known a station; <BR>165. `And, verily, we 
      are those who stand ranged in rows, <BR>166. And we, verily, are those who 
      glorify ALLAH.' <BR>167. And, surely, the Meccan disbelievers used to say, 
      <BR>168. `If we had with us a Reminder like that of the people of old, 
      <BR>169. `We would, surely, have been ALLAH's chosen servants.' <BR>170. 
      Yet when it has come to them they disbelieve therein, but they will soon 
      come to know. <BR>171. And, surely, Our word has gone forth to Our 
      servants, the Messengers, <BR>172. That it is, certainly, they who will be 
      helped; <BR>173. And that it is Our host that will, certainly, be 
      victorious. <BR>174. So turn thou away from them for a while. <BR>175. And 
      watch them, for they will soon see their own end. <BR>176. Is it then Our 
      punishment that they seek to hasten on ? <BR>177. But when it descends 
      into their courtyard, it shall be an evil morning for those who were 
      warned. <BR>178. So turn thou away from them for a while. <BR>179. And 
      watch, for they will soon see their own end. <BR>180. Holy is thy Lord, 
      the Lord of Power, far above that which they assert. <BR>181. And peace is 
      ever upon the Messengers ! <BR>182. And all praise belongs to ALLAH, the 
      Lord of the worlds.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
