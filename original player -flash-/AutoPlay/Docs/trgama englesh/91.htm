    <TD>80. Whoso obeys the Messenger obeys ALLAH indeed; and whoso turns 
      away, then WE have not sent thee to be a keeper over them. <BR>81. And 
      they say, `Obedience is our guiding principle;' but when they go forth 
      from thy presence, a section of them spends the night scheming against 
      what thou hast said. ALLAH records whatever they scheme by night. So turn 
      away from them, and put thy trust in ALLAH. And sufficient is ALLAH as a 
      Disposer of affairs. <BR>82. Will they not, then, meditate upon the Qur'an 
      ? Had it been from anyone other than ALLAH, they would surely have found 
      therein much discrepancy. <BR>83. And when there comes to them any tidings 
      whether of peace or of fear they spread it about, whereas if they had 
      referred it to the Messenger and to those in authority among them, surely 
      those of them, who can elicit the truth from it, would have understood it. 
      And had it not been for the grace of ALLAH upon you and HIS mercy, you 
      would have followed Satan, save a few. <BR>84. Fight, therefore, in the 
      way of ALLAH - thou art not made responsible except for thyself - and urge 
      on the believers to fight. It may be that ALLAH will restrain the might of 
      those that disbelieve; And ALLAH is stronger in might and stronger in 
      inflicting punishment. <BR>85. Whoso makes a righteous intercession shall 
      have a share thereof, and whoso makes an evil intercession, shall have a 
      like portion thereof; and ALLAH is Powerful over everything. <BR>86. And 
      when you are greeted with a greeting, greet ye with a better greeting or 
      at least return it. Surely ALLAH takes account of all 
  things.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
