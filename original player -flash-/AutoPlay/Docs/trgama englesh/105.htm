    <TD>171. O People of the Book ! exceed not the limits in your religion, 
      and say not of ALLAH anything but the truth. Verily, the Messiah, Jesus, 
      son of Mary, was only a Messenger of ALLAH, and a fulfillment of HIS word 
      which HE has sent down to Mary, and a mercy from HIM. So believe in ALLAH 
      and HIS Messengers, and say not, `They are three.' Desist, it will be 
      better for you. Verily, ALLAH is the only One God. Holy is HE, far above 
      having a son. To HIM belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in 
      the earth. And sufficient is ALLAH as a guardian. <BR>172. Surely, the 
      Messiah disdains not to be a servant of ALLAH, nor do the angels who are 
      near to Him, and whoso disdains to worship HIM and is proud, HE will 
      gather them all to Himself. <BR>173. Then as for those who believe and do 
      good works, HE will give them their rewards in full and will give them 
      more out of HIS grace; but as for those who disdain and are proud, HE will 
      punish them with a painful punishment. And they shall find for themselves 
      beside ALLAH no friend, nor helper. <BR>174. O ye people, manifest proof 
      has indeed come to you from your Lord, and WE have sent down to you a 
      clear Light. <BR>175. Then, as for those who believe in ALLAH and hold 
      fast to HIM, HE will surely admit them to HIS mercy and grace and will 
      guide them along a straight path leading to 
Himself.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
