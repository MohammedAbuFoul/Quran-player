    <TD>84. WE established him in the earth and gave him the means to achieve 
      everything. <BR>85. The he followed a certain way. <BR>86. Until when he 
      reached the setting-place of the sun, he found it setting as if in a pool 
      of murky water, and near it he found a people. WE said, `O Dhu'l Qarnain, 
      you may punish them, or treat them with kindness.' <BR>87. He said, `As 
      for him who does wrong, we shall certainly punish him; then shall he be 
      brought back to his Lord, who will punish him with a dreadful punishment; 
      <BR>88. `But as for him who believes and act righteously, he will have a 
      good reward with his Lord, and We too shall speak to him easy words of Our 
      command.' <BR>89. Then indeed he followed another way. <BR>90. Until he 
      reached the rising-place of the sun, he found it rising on a people for 
      whom WE had made no shelter against it. <BR>91. Thus indeed it was. 
      Verily, WE had full knowledge of all that he had with him. <BR>92. Then he 
      followed another way. <BR>93. Until when he reached the open place between 
      the two mountain mountains, he found, beneath them a people who could 
      scarcely understand a word of what he said. <BR>94. They said, `O Dhu'l 
      Qarnain, verily, Gog and Magog are creating disorder in the earth; shall 
      we then pay tribute on condition that thou set up a barrier between us and 
      them ?' <BR>95. He replied, `The power with which my Lord has endowed me 
      about this is better than the resources of my enemies but you may help me 
      with strength of labourers, I will set up a rampart between you and them; 
      <BR>96. `Bring me blocks of iron.' They did so till, when he had filled up 
      the space between the two mountains sides, he said, `Now blow with your 
      bellows.' They blew till, when he had made it red as fire, he said, `Bring 
      me molten copper that I may pour it thereon.' <BR>97. So they (Gog and 
      Magog) were not able to scale it, nor were they able to dig through 
    it.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
