    <TD>17. The end of both is that they are both in the Fire, abiding 
      therein. Such is the reward of the wrongdoers. <BR>18. O ye who believe ! 
      be mindful of your duty to ALLAH and let every soul look to what it sends 
      forth for the morrow. And fear ALLAH, verily, ALLAH is Well-Aware of what 
      you do. <BR>19. And be not like those who forgot ALLAH, so HE caused them 
      to forget their own souls. It is they that are the transgressors. <BR>20. 
      The inmates of the Fire and the inmates of the Garden are not equal. It is 
      the inmates of the Garden that are the triumphant. <BR>21. If WE had sent 
      down this Qur'an on a mountain, thou wouldst, certainly, have seen it 
      humbled and rent asunder for fear of ALLAH . And these are similitudes 
      that WE set forth for mankind that they may reflect. <BR>22. HE is ALLAH 
      and there is no god beside HIM, the Knower of the unseen and the seen. HE 
      is the Gracious, the Merciful. <BR>23. HE is ALLAH and there is no god 
      beside HIM, the Sovereign, the Holy One, the Source of peace, the Bestower 
      of security, the Protector, the Mighty, the Subduer, the Exalted. Holy is 
      ALLAH, far above that which they associate with HIM. <BR>24. HE is ALLAH, 
      the creator, the Maker, the Fashioner. HIS are the most beautiful names. 
      All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifies HIM, and HE is the 
      Mighty, the Wise.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
