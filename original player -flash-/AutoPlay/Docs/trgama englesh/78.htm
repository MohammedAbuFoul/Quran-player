    <TD>7. For men is a share of that which parents leave and near relations 
      leave; and for women is a share of that which parents and near relations 
      leave, whether it be little or much - a determined share. <BR>8. And when 
      other relations and orphans and the poor are present at the division of 
      the heritage, give them something therefrom and speak to them words of 
      kindness. <BR>9. And let those fear ALLAH who, if they should leave behind 
      them weak offspring, would be afraid on their account. Let them, 
      therefore, fear ALLAH and let them say the right word. <BR>10. Surely they 
      who devour the property of the orphans unjustly, only swallow fire into 
      their bellies, and they shall burn in a blazing fire. <BR>11. ALLAH 
      commands you concerning your children; a male shall have as much as the 
      share of two females; but if their be females only, numbering more than 
      two, then they shall have two-thirds of what the deceased leave; and if 
      there be one, she shall have the half. And his parents each of them a 
      sixth of the inheritance, if he have a child, but if he have no child and 
      his parents be his heirs, then his mother shall have a third; and if he 
      have brothers and sisters, then his mother shall have a sixth, after the 
      payment of any bequests he may have bequeathed or of debts. Your fathers 
      and your children; you know not which of them is more beneficent to you. 
      This fixing of portions is from ALLAH. Surely, ALLAH is All-Knowing, 
    Wise.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
