    <TD>28. And WE sent not down against his people, after him, any host from 
      heaven, nor do WE send down any such. <BR>29. It was but a single blast 
      and lo ! they were extinct. <BR>30. Alas for my servants ! there comes not 
      a Messenger to them but they mock at him. <BR>31. Do they not see how many 
      generations WE have destroyed before them, and that they never come back 
      to them ? <BR>32. And all of them, gathered together, will certainly be 
      brought before US. <BR>33. And the dead earth is a Sign for them; WE 
      quicken it and bring forth therefrom grain, of which they eat. <BR>34. And 
      WE have placed in it Gardens of date-palms and grapes, and WE have caused 
      springs to gush forth therein, <BR>35. That they may eat of the fruit 
      thereof, and it was not there hands that made them grow up. Will they not 
      then be grateful ? <BR>36. Holy is HE Who created all things in pairs, of 
      what the earth grows and of themselves, and of what they know not. <BR>37. 
      And a Sign for them is the night from which WE strip off the day, and lo ! 
      they are left in darkness. <BR>38. And the sun is moving on to its 
      determined goal. That is the decree of the Almighty, the All-Knowing God. 
      <BR>39. And for the moon WE have appointed stages, till it becomes again 
      like an old dry twig of a palm-tree. <BR>40. It is not for the sun to 
      overtake the moon, nor can the night outstrip the day. All of them float 
      smoothly in an orbit.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
