    <TD>24. And the only answer of his people was that they said, `Slay him or 
      burn him.' But ALLAH delivered him from the fire. In that, surely, are, 
      Signs for a people who believe. <BR>25. And Abraham said, `Verily, you 
      have taken for yourselves idols beside ALLAH, out of love for each other 
      in the present life. Then on the Day of Resurrection you will deny each 
      other, and curse each other. And your abode will be the Fire; and you will 
      have no helpers.' <BR>26. And Lot believed in him, and Abraham said, `I 
      flee unto my Lord; surely, HE is the Mighty, the Wise.' <BR>27. And WE 
      bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and WE placed Prophethood and the Book 
      among his descendants, and WE gave him his reward in this life, and in the 
      Hereafter he will, surely, be among the righteous. <BR>28. And call to 
      mind Lot when he said to his people, `You commit an abomination such as no 
      one among mankind has ever committed before you; <BR>29. What ! Do you 
      approach men with lust and commit robbery on the highway, and you commit 
      abomination in your meetings ?' But the only answer of his people was that 
      they said, `Bring upon us the punishment of ALLAH if thou speakest the 
      truth.' <BR>30. He said, `Help me, my Lord, against the wicked people.'
