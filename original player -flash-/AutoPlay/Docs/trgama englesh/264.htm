    <TD>32. God said, `O Iblis, what has happened to thee that thou wouldst 
      not be among those who submit ?' <BR>33. He answered, `I am not going to 
      submit to a mortal whom Thou hast created of dry ringing clay, of black 
      mud wrought into shape.' <BR>34. God said, `Then get out hence, for 
      surely, thou art rejected. <BR>35. And, surely, on thee shall be MY curse 
      till the day of Judgment.' <BR>36. He said, `My Lord, then grant me 
      respite till the day when they shall be raised.' <BR>37. God said, `Thou 
      art of those who are respited. <BR>38. `Till the day of the appointed 
      time., <BR>39. He answered, `My Lord, since Thou hast adjudged me as gone 
      astray, I will surely make straying from the right path appear beautiful 
      to them on the earth and I will surely lead them all astray, <BR>40. 
      `Except Thy chosen servants from among them.' <BR>41. God said, `This is a 
      path leading straight to ME; <BR>42. `Surely, thou shall have no power 
      over MY servants, except such of the erring ones as choose to follow 
      thee.' <BR>43. And, surely, Hell is the promised place for them all. 
      <BR>44. It has seven gates, and each gate has a portion of them allotted 
      to it. <BR>45. Verily, the righteous, will be placed amid gardens and 
      fountains. <BR>46. `Enter therein with peace, in security.' <BR>47. And WE 
      shall remove whatever of rancour may be in their breasts so that they will 
      be as brothers seated on thrones, facing one another; <BR>48. Fatigue 
      shall not touch them, nor shall they ever be ejected therefrom. <BR>49. 
      Tell MY servants, O Prophet, that I am surely, All-Forgiving, 
      All-Merciful. <BR>50. And also that MY punishment is the most grievous 
      punishment. <BR>51. And tell the about Abraham's 
guest.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
