    <TD>28. `And when thou art settled in the Ark - thou and those that are 
      with thee - say, `All praise belongs to ALLAH who has saved us from the 
      unjust people.' <BR>29. And when thou dost disembark from the Ark say, My 
      Lord, cause me to land a blessed landing, for Thou art the Best of those 
      who bring people to land.' <BR>30. Verily in this there are Signs. Surely, 
      WE do try people. <BR>31. Then WE raised after them another generation. 
      <BR>32. And WE sent among them a Messenger from among themselves with the 
      Message, `Serve ALLAH, you have no god other than HIM. Will you not then 
      make HIM your shield against all calamities ? <BR>33. And the chiefs of 
      his people, who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the Hereafter with 
      their Lord and whom WE had afforded ease and comfort in this life, said, 
      `This is but a mortal like yourselves. He eats of that which you eat, and 
      drinks of that which you drink; <BR>34. `And if you obey a mortal like 
      yourselves, you will then be surely losers; <BR>35. `Does he promise you 
      that when you are dead and have become dust and bones, you will be brought 
      forth again ? <BR>36. `Far, very far from truth is that which you are 
      promised; <BR>37. `There is no life other than our present life; we die 
      and we live, and we shall not be raised up again; <BR>38. `He is only a 
      man who has forged a lie against ALLAH; and we are not going to believe in 
      him.' <BR>39. He said, `My Lord, help me, for they treat me as a liar.' 
      <BR>40. ALLAH said, `In a little while they will, surely, become 
      repentant.' <BR>41. Then punishment overtook them rightfully, and WE made 
      them as rubbish. Cursed, then, be the people who do wrong ! <BR>42. Then 
      WE raised after them other 
generations.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
