    <TD>62. They swear by ALLAH to you to please you; but ALLAH with HIS 
      Messenger has greater right that they should please HIM if they are 
      believers. <BR>63. Do they not know that whoso opposes ALLAH and HIS 
      Messenger, for him is the fire of Hell, wherein he shall abide ? That is a 
      great humiliation. <BR>64. The Hypocrites pretend they fear lest a Surah 
      should be revealed concerning them, informing them of what is in their 
      hearts. Say, `Mock on; surely, ALLAH will bring to light that of which you 
      pretended you were afraid lest it might be disclosed. <BR>65. And if thou 
      question them, they will most surely say, `We were only talking idly and 
      jesting.' Say, `Was it ALLAH and HIS Signs and HIS Messenger that you 
      mocked at ?' <BR>66. Make ye no excuses. You certainly disbelieved after 
      believing. If WE forgive a party from among you, a party shall WE punish, 
      for they are guilty. <BR>67. The hypocrites, men and women, are all as one 
      to another. They enjoin evil and forbid good, and withhold their hands 
      from spending for the cause of ALLAH. They forgot ALLAH, So HE has 
      forgotten them. Surely, the hypocrites are the transgressors. <BR>68. 
      ALLAH promises the hypocrites, men and women, and the disbelievers the 
      fire of Hell, wherein they shall abide. It will suffice them. And ALLAH 
      has cursed them. And they shall have a lasting 
  punishment.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
