    <TD>29. And when Moses had fulfilled the term, and set forth with his 
      family, he perceived a fire in the direction of the Mount. He said to his 
      family, `Wait, I perceive a fire; haply I may bring you some useful 
      information therefrom, or a burning brand from the fire that you may warm 
      yourselves.' <BR>30. And when he came to it, he was called by a voice from 
      the right side of the Valley, in the blessed spot, out of the tree; `O 
      Moses, Verily, I am ALLAH, the Lord of the worlds; <BR>31. Cast down thy 
      rod.' And when he saw it move as though it were a serpent, he turned back 
      retreating and did not look back. `O Moses,' said the voice, `Come forward 
      and fear not; surely, thou art of those who are safe, <BR>32. Insert thy 
      hand into thy bosom; it will come forth white without evil effect, and 
      draw back thy arm toward thyself in order to still thy fear. So these 
      shall be two proofs from thy Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs. Surely, they 
      are a rebellious people. <BR>33. Moses said, `My Lord, I killed a person 
      from among them, and I fear that they will kill me; <BR>34. `And my 
      brother Aaron - he is more eloquent in speech than I; send him, therefore, 
      with me as a helper that he may bear witness to my truth. I fear that they 
      will charge me with falsehood.' <BR>35. God said, `We will strengthen 
      thine arm with thy brother, and WE will give power to you both so that 
      they shall not reach you. So go with Our Signs. You two and those who 
      follow you will prevail.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
