    <TD>56. But the only answer of his people was that they said, `Drive out 
      Lot's family from your city. They are a people who would keep pure. 
      <BR>57. So WE saved him and his family, except his wife; her WE decreed to 
      be of those who stayed behind. <BR>58. And WE rained upon them a rain; and 
      evil was the rain that descended upon those who had been warned. <BR>59. 
      Say, `All praise belongs to ALLAH, and peace be upon those servants of HIS 
      whom HE has chosen. Is ALLAH better or that which they associate with HIM 
      ? <BR>60. Or, Who created the heavens and the earth, and Who sent down 
      water for you from the sky wherewith WE cause to grow beautiful orchards ? 
      You could not cause their trees to grow. Is there a god with ALLAH ? Nay, 
      they are a people who deviate from the right path. <BR>61. Or, Who made 
      the earth a place of rest, and placed rivers in its midst, and placed upon 
      it firm mountains, and put a barrier between the two waters ? Is there a 
      god with ALLAH ? Nay, most of them know not. <BR>62. Or, Who answers the 
      cry of the distressed person when he calls upon HIM, and removes the evil, 
      and makes you successors in the earth ? Is there a god with ALLAH ? Little 
      is that you reflect. <BR>63. Or, Who guides you in the depths of darkness 
      on land and sea, and Who sends the winds as glad tidings before HIS mercy 
      ? Is there a god with ALLAH ? Exalted is ALLAH above what they associate 
      with HIM.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
