    <TD>15. None shall enter it but the most wicked one, <BR>16. Who rejects 
      the truth and turns his back on it. <BR>17. But the righteous one shall be 
      kept away from it, <BR>18. Who gives his wealth that he may be purified, 
      <BR>19. And not because he owes a favour to anyone, which is to be repaid, 
      <BR>20. But solely to seek the pleasure of his Lord, the Most High. 
      <BR>21. Surely, will HE be well-pleased with him. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. By the brightness of the forenoon, <BR>2. And by the night when its 
      darkness spreads out, <BR>3. Thy Lord has not forsaken thee, nor is HE 
      displeased with thee. <BR>4. Surely, thy latter state is better for thee 
      than the former, <BR>5. And thy Lord will soon give thee, and thou wilt be 
      well-pleased. <BR>6. Did HE not find thee an orphan and take thee under 
      HIS care, <BR>7. And found thee lost in love for thy people and provided 
      thee with guidance for them, <BR>8. And found thee in want and enriched 
      thee ? <BR>9. So the orphan, oppress not, <BR>10. And him, who seeks thy 
      help, chide not, <BR>11. And the bounty of thy Lord, proclaim. <BR>&nbsp;
      <HR width="90%" color=#000000 SIZE=3>
      1. Have WE not opened for thee thy bosom, <BR>2. And removed from thee thy 
      burden, <BR>3. Which had well-nigh broken thy back ? <BR>4. And WE have 
      exalted thy name. <BR>5. Surely, there is ease after hardship. <BR>6. Aye, 
      surely, there is ease after hardship. <BR>7. So when thou art free from 
      thy immediate task, strive hard, <BR>8. And to thy Lord do thou turn with 
      full attention.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
