    <TD>39. He it is Who made you successors in the earth of those who have 
      passed away. So he, who disbelieves, will himself suffer the consequences 
      of his disbelief. Their disbelief will bring the disbelievers no increase 
      in the sight of their Lord except HIS displeasure, and their disbelief 
      will increase for the disbelievers nothing but loss. <BR>40. Say, `Have 
      you seen your associate-gods whom you call on beside ALLAH ? Show me, 
      then, what they have created of the earth. Or they have a share in the 
      creation of the heavens ? Or, have WE given them a Book so that they have 
      an evidence therefrom ?' Nay, the wrongdoers promise one another nothing 
      but delusion. <BR>41. Surely, ALLAH holds the heavens and the earth lest 
      they deviate from their positions. And if they did deviate, none can hold 
      them back but HE. Verily, HE is Forbearing, Most Forgiving. <BR>42. And 
      they swore by ALLAH their strongest oaths, that if a Warner came to them, 
      they would follow guidance better than any other people. But when a Warner 
      did come to them, it only increased them in aversion, <BR>43. For, they 
      sought exaltation in the earth and devised evil schemes. But the evil 
      schemes encompass none but the authors thereof. Do they, then, look for 
      anything other than ALLAH's way of dealing with the people of old ? But 
      thou wilt never find any change in the way of ALLAH; nor wilt thou ever 
      find any alteration in the way of ALLAH. <BR>44. Have they not traveled in 
      the earth and seen how evil was the end of those who were before them ? 
      And they were stronger than these in power. And ALLAH is not such that 
      anything in the heavens or the earth can frustrate HIS plans; verily, HE 
      is All-Knowing, 
All-Powerful.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
