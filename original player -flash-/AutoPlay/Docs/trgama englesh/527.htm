    <TD>27. Those, who believe not in the Hereafter, give the angels female 
      names; <BR>28. But they have no knowledge thereof. They follow nothing but 
      conjecture; and conjecture avails naught against truth. <BR>29. So turn 
      away from him who turns his back upon Our remembrance, and seeks nothing 
      but the life of this world. <BR>30. That is the utmost limit of their 
      knowledge. Verily, thy Lord knows best him who strays away from His way, 
      and HE knows best him who follows guidance. <BR>31. And to ALLAH belongs 
      whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, that HE may 
      requite those who do evil according to what they have wrought and reward 
      those who do good with what is best; <BR>32. Those who shun the grave sins 
      and all indecencies except minor faults. Verily, thy Lord is Master of 
      vast forgiveness. HE knows you well from the time when HE created you from 
      the earth, and when you were embryos in the bellies of your mothers. So 
      ascribe not purity to yourselves. HE knows him best who is truly 
      righteous. <BR>33. Seest thou him who turns away from guidance, <BR>34. 
      And gives a little, and does it grudgingly ? <BR>35. Has he the knowledge 
      of the unseen, so that he can see his own end ? <BR>36. Has he not been 
      informed of what is in the Scriptures of Moses, <BR>37. And of Abraham who 
      fulfilled the divine commandments ? <BR>38. That no bearer of burden shall 
      bear the burden of another, <BR>39. And that man will have nothing but 
      what he strives for; <BR>40. And that the result of his striving shall 
      soon be known; <BR>41. Then will he be rewarded for it with the fullest 
      reward; <BR>42. And that with thy Lord is the final judgment; <BR>43. And 
      that it is HE WHO makes people laugh and makes them weep; <BR>44. And that 
      it is HE Who causes death and gives 
life;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
