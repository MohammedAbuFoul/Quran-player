    <TD>7. How can there be a treaty for these idolaters with ALLAH and HIS 
      Messenger, Except those with whom you entered into a treaty at the Sacred 
      Mosque ? So, as long as they are true to them. Surely ALLAH loves those 
      who fulfill their obligations. <BR>8. How can it be when, if they prevail 
      against you, they would not observe any tie of kinship or covenant in 
      respect of you. They would please you with their mouths, while their heart 
      repudiate what they say and most of them are perfidious. <BR>9. They have 
      bartered the Signs of ALLAH for a paltry price and have turned men away 
      from HIS way. Evil indeed is that which they do. <BR>10. They observe not 
      any tie of kinship or covenant in respect of any believer. And it is they 
      who are transgressors. <BR>11. But if they repent and observe Prayer and 
      pay the Zakat, then they are your brethren in Faith. And WE explain the 
      Signs for a people who have knowledge. <BR>12. And if they break their 
      oaths after their covenant, and attack your religion, then fight these 
      leaders of disbelief -- surely, they have no regard for their oaths, - 
      that they may desist. <BR>13. Will you not fight a people who have broken 
      their oaths, and who plotted to turn out the Messenger, and they were the 
      first to commence hostilities against you ? Do you fear them ? Nay, ALLAH 
      is most worthy that you should fear HIM, if you are 
  believers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
