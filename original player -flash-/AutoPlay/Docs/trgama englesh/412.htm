    <TD>12. And WE bestowed wisdom on Luqm?n and said, `Be grateful to ALLAH,' 
      for, whoso is grateful, is grateful for the good of his own soul. And 
      whoso is ungrateful, then, surely, ALLAH is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy. 
      <BR>13. And call to mind when Luqman said to his son while he admonished 
      him. `O my dear son ! Associate not partners with ALLAH. Surely, 
      associating partners with ALLAH is a grievous wrong. <BR>14. And we have 
      enjoined on man to be good to his parents -his mother bears him in 
      weakness upon weakness, and his weaning takes two years - and said, `Give 
      thanks to ME and thy parents. Unto ME is the final return; <BR>15. And if 
      they contend with thee to make thee set up equals with ME concerning which 
      thou hast no knowledge, obey them not, but be a kind companion to them in 
      worldly affairs, and in spiritual matters follow the way of him who turns 
      to ME. Then unto ME will be your return and I shall inform you of what you 
      used to do; <BR>16. `O my dear son, even though it be the weight of a 
      grain of mustard seed, and even though it be in a rock, or in the heavens, 
      or in the earth, ALLAH will, surely, bring it out. Verily, ALLAH is the 
      knower of the most hidden secrets, and is All-Aware; <BR>17. `O my dear 
      son, observe Prayer and enjoin good and forbid evil and endure patiently 
      whatever may befall thee. Surely, this is of those matters which require 
      high resolve; <BR>18. `And turn not thy cheek away from men in scorn, nor 
      walk in the earth haughtily; Surely, ALLAH loves not the arrogant boaster; 
      <BR>19. `And walk thou at a moderate pace, and lower thy voice; verily, 
      the most hateful of voices is the braying of the 
ass.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
