    <TD>74. The guilty will, certainly, abide in the punishment of Hell. 
      <BR>75. It will not be lightened for them, and they will be seized therein 
      with despair. <BR>76. And WE wronged them not, but it was they themselves 
      who were the wrongdoers. <BR>77. And they will cry, `O Malik ! let thy 
      Lord make an end of us.' He will say, `You must stay here.' <BR>78. ALLAH 
      will say, `WE, certainly, brought you the truth; but most of you were 
      averse to the truth.' <BR>79. Have they determined upon a course to 
      compass thy end ? Then WE, too, have determined their destruction. <BR>80. 
      Do they think that WE hear not their secrets and their private counsels ? 
      Yea ! and Our Messengers remain with them recording everything. <BR>81. 
      Say, `If the Gracious God had a son, I would have been the first of 
      worshippers.' <BR>82. Holy is ALLAH, the Lord of the heavens and the earth 
      , the Lord of the Throne, far above that which they attribute to HIM. 
      <BR>83. So leave them alone to indulge in vain discourse and to amuse 
      themselves until they meet that Day of theirs which they have been 
      promised. <BR>84. HE it is Who is God in heaven, and God on earth; and HE 
      is the Wise, the All-Knowing. <BR>85. And blessed is HE to Whom belongs 
      the Kingdom of the Heavens and the earth and all that is between them, and 
      with HIM is the knowledge of the Hour, and to HIM shall you all be brought 
      back. <BR>86. And those on whom they call beside HIM possess no power of 
      intercession but only he may intercede who bears witness to the truth, and 
      they know this well. <BR>87. And if thou ask them, `Who created them ?' 
      They will surely, say, `ALLAH.' How, then, are they being turned away ? 
      <BR>88. WE call to witness the Prophets repeated cry : `O my Lord ! these 
      are a people who will not believe.' <BR>89. And Our reply was, `So turn 
      aside from them, and say, `Peace;' and soon shall they 
  know.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
