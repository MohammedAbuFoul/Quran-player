    <TD>14. Unto Him alone is due the true Prayer. And those on whom they call 
      instead of HIM answer them not at all. Their case is but like the case of 
      him who stretches forth his two hands towards water that it may reach his 
      mouth, but it reaches it not. And the prayer of a disbeliever is but a 
      thing wasted. <BR>15. And to ALLAH submits whosoever is in the heavens and 
      the earth willingly or unwillingly and like wise do their shadows in the 
      mornings and the evenings. <BR>16. Say, `Who is the Lord of the heavens 
      and the earth ?' Say, `ALLAH.' Say, `Have you then taken instead of HIM 
      helpers who have no power for good or harm even for themselves ?' Say, 
      `Can the blind and the seeing be equal ? Or can darkness be equal to light 
      ? Or, do they assign to ALLAH partners who have created the like of HIS 
      creation so that the two creations appear similar to them ?' Say, `ALLAH 
      alone is the Creator of all things, and HE is the One, the Most supreme.' 
      <BR>17. HE sends down water from the sky so that the valleys flow 
      according to their measure and the flood bears on its surface swelling 
      foam. And from that which they heat in the fire, seeking to make ornaments 
      or utensils, comes out a foam similar to it. Thus does ALLAH illustrate 
      truth and falsehood. Now, as to the foam it goes away as rubbish and 
      perishes but as to that which benefits men, it stays in the earth. Thus 
      does ALLAH set forth parables. <BR>18. For those who respond to their Lord 
      is external good; and as for those who respond not to HIM, if they had all 
      that is in the earth and the like of it added thereto, they would readily 
      ransom themselves therewith. It is these that shall have an evil reckoning 
      and their abode is Hell. What a wretched place of rest
