    <TD>29. Seest thou not that ALLAH makes the night pass into the day and 
      makes the day pass into the night, and HE has pressed the sun and the moon 
      into service; each pursuing its course till an appointed term, and that 
      ALLAH is Well-Aware of what you do. <BR>30. That is because it is ALLAH 
      alone Who is the True God, and whatever they call upon beside HIM is 
      false, and because it is ALLAH alone Who is the Most High, the 
      Incomparably Great. <BR>31. Dost thou not see that the ships sail on the 
      sea by the favour of ALLAH, that HE may show you of HIS Signs ? Therein, 
      surely, are Signs for every patient and grateful person. <BR>32. And when 
      waves engulf them like so many coverings, they call upon ALLAH, in full 
      sincerity of faith; but when HE brings them to safe land, then some of 
      them keep to the right course. And none denies Our Signs save every 
      perfidious, ungrateful person. <BR>33. O men, seek protection with your 
      Lord and fear the day when the father will not be of any avail to his 
      child, nor will the child at all be of any avail to his father. ALLAH's 
      promise is, surely, true. So let not worldly life beguile you, nor let the 
      Deceiver deceive you concerning ALLAH. <BR>34. Verily, with ALLAH alone is 
      the knowledge of the Hour. And HE sends down the rain, and HE knows what 
      is in the wombs. And no soul knows what it will earn tomorrow, and no soul 
      knows in what land it will die. Surely, ALLAH is All-Knowing, 
    All-Aware.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
