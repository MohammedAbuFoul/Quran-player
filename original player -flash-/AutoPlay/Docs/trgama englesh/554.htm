    <TD>9. O ye who believe ! When the call is made for Prayer on Friday, 
      hasten to the remembrance of ALLAH, and leave off all business. That is 
      best for you, if you only knew. <BR>10. And when the Prayer is finished, 
      then disperse in the land and seek of ALLAH's grace, and remember ALLAH 
      much that you may prosper. <BR>11. But when they see some merchandise or 
      amusement, they break up for it, and leave thee standing. Say, `That which 
      is with ALLAH is better than amusement and merchandise, and ALLAH is the 
      best providers.' <BR>&nbsp;

      1. When the Hypocrites come to thee, they say, `We bear witness that thou 
      art the Messenger of ALLAH.' And ALLAH knows that thou art indeed HIS 
      Messenger, but ALLAH also bears witness that the Hypocrites certainly are 
      liars. <BR>2. They have made their oaths a cloak; thus they hinder men 
      from the way of ALLAH. Surely, evil is that which they have been doing. 
      <BR>3. That is because they first believed and then disbelieved. So a seal 
      was set upon their hearts and consequently they understand not. <BR>4. And 
      when thou seest them, their figures please thee; and when they speak, thou 
      listenest to their speech. They are as though they were blocks of wood 
      propped up. They think that every cry is against them. They are the enemy, 
      so beware of them. ALLAH's curse be upon them, how are they being turned 
      away from the truth !&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
