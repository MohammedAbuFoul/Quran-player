    <TD>3. Forbidden to you is the flesh of an animal which dies of itself, 
      and blood and the flesh of swine; and that on which is invoked the name of 
      any other than ALLAH; and that which has been strangled; and that which 
      has been beaten to death; and that which has been killed by a fall and 
      that which has been gored to death; and that of which a wild animal has 
      eaten, except that which you have properly slaughtered; and that which has 
      been slaughtered at an altar as an offering to idols. And forbidden is 
      also this that you seek to know your lot by the divining arrows. That is 
      an act of disobedience. This day have those who disbelieve despaired of 
      harming your religion. So fear them not, but fear ME. This day have I 
      perfected your religion for you and completed MY favour upon you and have 
      chosen for you Islam as religion. But whoso is forced by hunger, without 
      being wilfully inclined to sin, then, surely, ALLAH is Most Forgiving, and 
      is Merciful. <BR>4. They ask thee what is made lawful for them. Say, `All 
      good things have been made lawful for you, and what you have taught the 
      beasts and the birds of prey to catch for you, training them for hunting 
      and teaching them of what ALLAH has taught you. So eat of that which they 
      catch for you, and pronounce thereon the name of ALLAH. And fear ALLAH, 
      surely ALLAH is Quick in reckoning.' <BR>5. This day all good things have 
      been made lawful for you. And the food of the people of the Book is lawful 
      for you. And your food is lawful for them. And lawful for you are chaste 
      believing women and chaste women from among those who were given the Book 
      before you, when you give them their dowries, contracting valid marriage 
      and not committing fornication, nor taking secret paramours. And whoever 
      rejects the faith, his work indeed is vain, and in the Hereafter he will 
      be among the losers.&nbsp;</TD></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
