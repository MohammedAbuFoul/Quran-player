    <TD>102. They will not hear the slightest sound thereof, and they shall 
      abide in the state which their souls desire. <BR>103. The Great Terror 
      will not grieve them, and the angels will meet them, saying, `This is your 
      day which you were promised; <BR>104. `The day when WE shall roll up the 
      heavens like the rolling up of written scrolls by a scribe.' As WE began 
      the first creation, So shall WE repeat it - a promise binding upon US; WE 
      shall certainly fulfill it. <BR>105. And WE have already written in the 
      Book of David, after the reminder, that MY righteous servants shall 
      inherit the Land. <BR>106. Herein, surely, is a message for a people who 
      worship God. <BR>107. And WE have not sent thee but as a mercy for all 
      peoples. <BR>108. Say, `Surely it has been revealed to me that your god is 
      but One God. Will you then submit ?' <BR>109. But if they turn back, say, 
      `I have warned you all alike and I know not whether that which you are 
      promised is near or far; <BR>110. Verily, HE knows what is open in speech, 
      and HE knows that which you hide; <BR>111. `And I know not but that it may 
      be a trial for you, and only an enjoyment for a while.' <BR>112. And the 
      Prophet said, `My Lord, judge thou with truth. Our Lord is the Gracious 
      God Whose help is sought against that which you 
  assert.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
