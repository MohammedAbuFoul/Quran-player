    <TD>58. And the good land - its vegetation comes forth plentifully by the 
      command of its Lord; and that which is bad, its vegetation does not come 
      forth but scantily. In like manner do WE expound the Signs in various 
      forms for a people who are grateful. <BR>59. WE sent Noah to his people 
      and he said, `O my people, worship ALLAH, you have no other god but HIM. 
      Indeed I fear for you the punishment of the great day.' <BR>60. The chiefs 
      of his people said, `Surely we see thee to be in manifest error.' <BR>61. 
      He said, `O my people, there is no error in me, but I am a Messenger from 
      the Lord of the worlds; <BR>62. `I deliver to you the Messages of my Lord 
      and give you sincere advice and I know from ALLAH what you know not; 
      <BR>63. `Do you wonder that an exhortation has come to you from your Lord 
      through a man from among yourselves, that he may warn you and that you may 
      become righteous and that you may be shown mercy ?' <BR>64. But they 
      called him a liar, so WE saved him and those with him in the Ark and WE 
      drowned those who rejected Our Signs. They were indeed a blind people. 
      <BR>65. And unto Ad WE sent their brother Hud. He said, `O my people, 
      worship ALLAH; you have no other deity but HIM. Will you not then fear HIM 
      ? <BR>66. The disbelieving chiefs of his people said, `We surely see the 
      lost in foolishness and we surely think thee to be one of the liars.' 
      <BR>67. He said, `O my people, there is no foolishness in me, but I am a 
      Messenger from the Lord of the 
worlds;&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
