    <TD>53. That is because ALLAH would never change a favour that HE has 
      conferred upon a people until they change their own condition, and know 
      that ALLAH is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. <BR>54. O disbelievers ! your 
      condition will also be like that of the people of Pharaoh and those before 
      them; they rejected the Signs of their Lord, so WE destroyed them for 
      their sins. And WE drowned the people of Pharaoh, for they were all 
      wrongdoers. <BR>55. Surely, the worst of beasts in the sight of ALLAH are 
      the disbelievers, who will not believe. <BR>56. Those with whom thou hast 
      made a covenant, - then they break their covenant every time, and they do 
      not fear ALLAH. <BR>57. So, if thou overcomest them in war, then thereby 
      strike fear in those that are behind them, that they may be mindful. 
      <BR>58. And if thou fearest treachery from a people, throw back to them 
      their covenant with equity. Surely, ALLAH loves not the treacherous. 
      <BR>59. And let not those who disbelieve think that they can outstrip US. 
      Surely, they cannot frustrate Our purpose. <BR>60. And make ready for them 
      who fight you whatever you can of armed force and of mounted pickets at 
      the frontier, whereby you may frighten the enemy of ALLAH and your enemy 
      and others besides them whom you know not, but ALLAH knows them. And 
      whatever you spend in the way of ALLAH, it shall be paid back to you in 
      full and you shall not be wronged. <BR>61. And if they incline towards 
      peace, incline thou also towards it, and put thy trust in ALLAH. Surely, 
      it is HE Who is All-Hearing, 
All-Knowing.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
