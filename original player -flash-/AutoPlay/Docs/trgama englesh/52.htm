    <TD>16. Those who say, `Our Lord, we do believe; forgive us, therefore, 
      our sins and save us from the punishment of the Fire; <BR>17. The 
      steadfast, and the truthful, and the humble, and those who spend in the 
      way of ALLAH and those who pray for pardon in the latter part of the 
      night. <BR>18. ALLAH bears witness that there is no god but HE - and also 
      do the angels and those possessed of knowledge, maintaining justice; there 
      is no god but HE, the Mighty, the Wise. <BR>19. Surely the true religion 
      with ALLAH is Islam. And those who were given the Book did not disagree 
      but, after knowledge had come to them, out of mutual envy. And whoso 
      denies the Signs of ALLAH, then surely ALLAH is quick at reckoning. 
      <BR>20. But if they dispute with thee, say `I have surrendered myself 
      completely to ALLAH, and also those who follow me.' And say to those who 
      have been given the Book and to the Unlearned, `Have you also surrendered 
      ? If they surrender, then they will surely be rightly guided, but if they 
      turn back, then thy duty is only to convey the Message. And ALLAH is 
      Watchful of HIS servants. <BR>21. Surely, those who deny the signs of 
      ALLAH and seek to slay the Prophets unjustly and seek to slay such men as 
      enjoin equity - announce to them a painful punishment. <BR>22. Those are 
      they whose deed shall come to naught in this world and in the next, and 
      they shall have no helpers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
