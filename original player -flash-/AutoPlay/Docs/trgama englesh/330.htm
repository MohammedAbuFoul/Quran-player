    <TD>91. And remember her who guarded her chastity, so WE breathed into her 
      of Our Word and WE made her and her son a Sign for all peoples. <BR>92. 
      Verily, this community of yours is one community and I am your Lord, so 
      worship ME. <BR>93. And they split up their affair among themselves and 
      all will return to US. <BR>94. So whoever does good works and is a 
      believer, his endeavour will not be rejected and WE shall surely record 
      it. <BR>95. And it is an inviolable law for a township which WE have 
      destroyed that they shall not return. <BR>96. It shall be so even when Gog 
      and Magog are let loose and they shall hasten forth from every height and 
      from the top of every wave. <BR>97. And the fulfillment of God's promise 
      draws nigh; then behold, the eyes of those who disbelieve will fixedly 
      stare and they will exclaim `Alas for us ! we were indeed heedless of 
      this; nay, we were wrongdoers.' <BR>98. It will be said to them, `Surely, 
      you and that which you worship beside ALLAH are the fuel of Hell. To it 
      you will all come. <BR>99. If these, as you allege, had been gods, they 
      would not have entered it; and all will abide therein. <BR>100. Therein 
      groaning will be their lot and they will not hear therein anything else. 
      <BR>101. But as for those for whom the promise of a good reward has 
      already gone forth from US, these will be removed far from 
  it.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
