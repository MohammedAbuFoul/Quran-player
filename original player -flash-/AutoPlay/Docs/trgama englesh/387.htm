    <TD>14. And when he reached his age of full strength and attained 
      maturity, WE bestowed wisdom and knowledge upon him; and thus do WE reward 
      those who do good. <BR>15. And one day he entered the city at a time when 
      its inhabitants were in a state of heedlessness; and he found therein two 
      men fighting - one of his own party and the other of his enemies. And he 
      who was of his party sought his help against him who was of his enemies. 
      So Moses struck the latter with his fist; and thereby caused his death. 
      Then Moses said, `This is Satan's doing, he is indeed an enemy, a manifest 
      misleader.' <BR>16. He said, `My Lord, I have wronged my soul, so do thou 
      forgive me.' So HE forgave him; HE is Most Forgiving, ever Merciful. 
      <BR>17. He said, `My Lord, because of the favour Thou hast bestowed upon 
      me, I will never be a helper of the guilty.' <BR>18. And morning found him 
      in the city, apprehensive, watchful; and lo ! he who had sought his help 
      the day before cried out to him again for help. Moses said to him, 
      `Verily, thou art manifestly a misguided fellow.' <BR>19. And when he made 
      up his mind to lay hold of the man who was an enemy to both of them, he 
      said, `O Moses, dost thou intend to kill me even as thou didst kill a 
      person yesterday ? Thou only desirest to be a tyrant in the land, and thou 
      desirest not to be a peace-maker.' <BR>20. And there came a man from the 
      far side of the city, running. He said, `O Moses, of a truth, the chiefs 
      are taking counsel together against thee to kill thee. Therefore get thee 
      away; surely;, I am thy well-wisher.' <BR>21. So he went forth therefrom, 
      fearful and watchful. He said, `My Lord, deliver me from the unjust 
      people.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
