    <TD>6. And to establish them in the earth, and to make Pharaoh and Haman 
      and their hosts see from them that which they feared. <BR>7. And WE 
      directed the mother of Moses by revelation, `Suckle him; and when thou 
      fearest for him, then cast him into the river and fear not, nor grieve; 
      for WE shall restore him to thee, and shall make him one of the 
      Messengers.' <BR>8. She did accordingly and one of the family of Pharaoh 
      picked him up so that he became for them an enemy and a source of sorrow. 
      Verily, Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were wrongdoers. <BR>9. And 
      Pharaoh's wife said, `He will be a joy of the eye for me and for thee. 
      Slay him not. Haply he may prove to be useful for us, or we may adopt him 
      as a son.' And they knew not Our purpose. <BR>10. And the heart of the 
      mother of Moses became free from anxiety. She had almost disclosed his 
      identity, were it not that WE had strengthen her heart so that she might 
      be of the firm believers. <BR>11. And she said to his sister, `Follow him 
      up.' So she observed him from afar; and they were unaware of this. <BR>12. 
      And WE had already decreed that he shall refuse the wet-nurse; so she 
      said, `Shall I direct you to the people of a household who will bring him 
      up for you and will be his sincere well-wishers ?' <BR>13. Thus WE 
      restored him to his mother that her eye might be gladdened and that she 
      might not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of ALLAH is 
      true. But most of people know 
not.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
