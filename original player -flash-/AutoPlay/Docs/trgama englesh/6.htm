    <TD>30. And when thy Lord said to the angels, "I am about to place 
      (mankind) generations after generations on earth." They said: "Will You 
      place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood, - while 
      we glorify You with praises and thanks and sanctify You." HE said: "I know 
      that which you do not know." <BR>31. And HE taught Adam all the names, 
      then HE put the objects of these names before the angles and said, `Tell 
      ME the names of these, if you are right,' <BR>32. They said, `Holy art 
      THOU ! No knowledge have we except what THOU hast taught us; surely THOU 
      art All-Knowing, the Wise.' <BR>33. HE said `O Adam, tell them their 
      names;' and when he had told them their names, HE said `Did I not say to 
      you, I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you 
      reveal and what you hide ? <BR>34. And remember the time when WE said to 
      the angels `Submit to ADAM,' and they all submitted. But Iblis did not. He 
      refused and deem himself too big; and he was of the disbelievers. <BR>35. 
      And when WE said `O Adam, dwell thou and thy wife in the paradise, and eat 
      therefrom plentifully where ever you will, but approach not this tree, 
      least you be of the wrongdoers.' <BR>36. But Satan caused them both to 
      slip by means of it and drove them out of the state in which they were. 
      And WE said, `Go forth hence; some of you are enemies of others and for 
      you there is an abode in the earth and a provision for a time.' <BR>37. 
      Then Adam learnt from his Lord certain words of prayer. So HE turned 
      towards him with mercy. Surely HE is Oft-Returning with compassion, and is 
      Merciful. &nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
