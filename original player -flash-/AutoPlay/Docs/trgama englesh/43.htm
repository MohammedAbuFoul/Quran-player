    <TD>257. ALLAH is the Friend of those who believe; HE brings them out of 
      all kinds of darkness into light. And those who disbelieve, their friends 
      are the transgressors who brings them out of light into manifold 
      darknesses. These are the inmates of the Fire, therein shall they 
      abide.<BR>258. Hast thou not heard of him who disputed with Abraham about 
      his Lord, because ALLAH has given him kingdom ? When Abraham said, `My 
      Lord is HE WHO gives life and causes death,' he said, `I also give life 
      and cause death.' Abraham said, `Well, ALLAH brings the sun from the East; 
      bring it thou from the West,' Thereupon the infidel was confounded. And 
      ALLAH guides not the unjust people.<BR>259. Or hast thou not heard of the 
      like of him who passed by a town which had fallen down upon its roofs and 
      exclaimed, `When will ALLAH restore it to life after its destruction ?' 
      Then ALLAH caused him to die for a hundred years, then HE raised him and 
      said, `How long hast thou remained in this state ?' He answered, `I have 
      remained a day or part of a day.' ALLAH said, `It is so but thou hast also 
      remained in this state for a hundred years. Now look at thy food and thy 
      drink; they have not rotted And look at thy ass. And WE have done this 
      that WE may make thee a Sign unto men. And look at the bones, how WE set 
      them and then clothe them with flesh.' And when this became clear to him, 
      he said, `I know that ALLAH has the power to do all that HE 
  wills.'</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
