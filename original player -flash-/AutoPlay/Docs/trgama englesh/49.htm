    <TD>283. And if you be on a journey, and you find not a scribe, then let 
      there be a pledge with possession. And if one of you entrust another with 
      something, then let him who is entrusted, surrender his trust and let him 
      fear ALLAH, his Lord. And hide not testimony; and whoever hides it his 
      heart is certainly sinful. And ALLAH is Well-Aware of what you do. 
      <BR>284. To ALLAH belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in 
      the earth; and whether you disclose what is in your minds or keep it 
      hidden, ALLAH will call you to account for it, then will HE forgive 
      whomsoever HE pleases, and punish whomsoever HE pleases; and ALLAH has the 
      power to do all that HE wills. <BR>285. This Messenger of OURS believes in 
      that which has been revealed to him from his Lord, and so do the 
      believers; all of them believe in ALLAH, and in HIS angels, and in HIS 
      Books, and in HIS Messengers, saying, `We make no distinction between any 
      of HIS Messengers;' and they say `We have heard and we are obedient. Our 
      Lord, we implore THY forgiveness, and to Thee is the returning.' <BR>286. 
      ALLAH burdens not any soul beyond its capacity. It shall have the reward 
      it earns, and it shall get the punishment it incurs. Our Lord, do not 
      punish us if we forget or fall into error, and our Lord, lay not on us a 
      responsibility as THOU didst lay upon those before us. Our Lord, burden us 
      not with what we have not he strength to bear; and efface our sins and 
      grant us forgiveness and have mercy on us; Thou art our Master; so help us 
      against the disbelieving 
people.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
