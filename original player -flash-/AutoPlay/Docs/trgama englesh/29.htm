    <TD>187. It is made lawful for you to go in unto your wives on the night 
      of the fast. They are a sort of garment for you and you are a sort of 
      garment for them. ALLAH knows that you have been acting unjustly to 
      yourselves, wherefore HE has turned to you with mercy and afforded you 
      relief. So you may now go in unto them and seek what ALLAH has ordained 
      for you; and eat and drink until the white thread becomes distinct to you 
      from the black tread of the dawn. Then complete the fast till nightfall 
      and do not go in unto them while you remain in the Mosques for devotion. 
      These are the limits set by ALLAH, so approach them not. Thus does ALLAH 
      make HIS commandments clear to men that they may become secure against 
      evil. <BR>188. And do not devour your property among yourselves by false 
      means and offer it not as bribe to the authorities that you may devour a 
      part of the wealth of other people wrongfully while you know. <BR>189. 
      They ask thee about the new moons. Say, `They are means for measuring 
      time, for the general convenience of people and for the Pilgrimage.' And 
      it is not righteousness that you come into houses by the backs thereof, 
      but truly righteous is he who fears God. And you should come into houses 
      by the doors thereof; and fear ALLAH that you may prosper.<BR>190. And 
      fight in the way of ALLAH against those who fight against you, but do not 
      transgress. Surely, ALLAH loves not the 
transgressors.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
