    <TD>1. Alif, Lam, Mim, Sad. <BR>2. This is a Book revealed unto thee - so 
      let there be no straightness in thy bosom concerning it - that thou mayest 
      warn thereby and that it be an exhortation to the believers. <BR>3. Follow 
      that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, and follow no 
      protectors other than HIM. But you seldom take warning. <BR>4. How many a 
      town have WE destroyed ! And our punishment came upon it by night or while 
      they slept at noon. <BR>5. So when our punishment came upon them, their 
      cry was nothing but they said, `We were indeed wrongdoers ! ' <BR>6. And 
      WE will certainly question those to whom the Messengers were sent and WE 
      will certainly question the Messengers. <BR>7. The will WE certainly 
      relate to them their deeds with knowledge, for WE were never absent. 
      <BR>8. And the weighing on that day will be true. Then as for those whose 
      scales are heavy, it is they who shall prosper. <BR>9. And as for those 
      whose scales are light, it is they who shall have ruined their souls 
      because of their being unjust concerning OUR Signs. <BR>10. And WE have 
      established you in the earth and provided for you therein the means of 
      subsistence. But little thanks do you give. <BR>11. And WE indeed created 
      you and then WE gave you shape; and then WE said to the angels, `Submit to 
      Adam; and they all submitted. But Iblis did not; he will not be of those 
      who submit.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
