    <TD>22. And when he turned his face towards Midian, he said, I hope, my 
      Lord will guide me to the right way.' <BR>23. And when he arrived at the 
      water of Midian, he found there a party of men, watering their flocks. And 
      he found beside them two women holding back their flocks. He said, `What 
      is your the problem ?' They replied, `We cannot water our flocks until the 
      shepherds depart with their flocks, and our father is a very old man.' 
      <BR>24. So he watered their flocks for them. Then he turned aside into the 
      shade and said, `My Lord, I stand in need of whatever good Thou mayest 
      send down to me.' <BR>25. And one of the two women came to him, walking 
      bashfully. She said, `My father calls thee that he may reward thee for thy 
      having watered our flocks for us.' So when he came to him and told him the 
      story, he said, `Fear not; thou hast escaped from the unjust people.' 
      <BR>26. One of the two women said, `O my father, take him into thy 
      service; for the best man that thou canst employ is the one who is strong 
      and trustworthy.' <BR>27. Their father said to Moses, `I intend to marry 
      to thee one of these two daughters of mine on condition that thou stay in 
      my service for eight years. But if thou complete ten years, it will be of 
      thine own accord. And I would not lay any hardship upon thee; thou wilt 
      find me, if ALLAH wills, of the righteous.' <BR>28. Moses said, `That is 
      settled between me and thee. Whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there 
      shall be no injustice to me; and ALLAH watches over what we 
  say.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
