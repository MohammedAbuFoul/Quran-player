    <TD>31. O children of Adam ! take your adornment at every time and place 
      of worship, and eat and drink, but be not immoderate; surely, HE does not 
      love those who are immoderate. <BR>32. Say, `Who has forbidden the 
      adornment of ALLAH which HE has produced for HIS servants and the good 
      things of HIS providing ?' Say, `They are for the believers in the present 
      life and will be exclusively for them on the Day of Resurrection.' Thus do 
      WE explain the Signs for a people who have knowledge. <BR>33. Say, `My 
      Lord has only forbidden indecencies, open or secret and sin and wrongful 
      transgression and that you associate with ALLAH that for which HE has sent 
      down no authority, and that you say of ALLAH what you know not.' <BR>34. 
      And for every people there is a term, and when their term is come, they 
      cannot remain behind a single moment, nor can they get ahead of it. 
      <BR>35. O children of Adam, If Messengers come to you from among 
      yourselves, rehearsing MY Signs unto you, then whoso shall fear God and do 
      good deeds, on them shall come no fear nor shall they grieve. <BR>36. But 
      those who reject OUR Signs and turn away from them with disdain, - these 
      are the inmates of the Fire; they shall abide therein. <BR>37. Who is, 
      then, more unjust than he who forges a lie against ALLAH or gives the lie 
      to HIS Signs ? It is these who shall have their lot as ordained till when 
      OUR Messengers shall visit them to take away their souls, they shall say, 
      `Where is that which you used to call upon besides ALLAH ?' they will 
      answer, `We cannot find them;' and they will bear witness against 
      themselves that they were 
disbelievers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
