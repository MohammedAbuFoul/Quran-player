    <TD>48. And WE showed them no Sign but it was greater than its preceding 
      sister Sign, and WE seized them with punishment, that they might turn to 
      US. <BR>49. And each time they said, `O thou sorcerer, pray for us to thy 
      Lord, according to the promise HE made with thee that if HE avert this 
      evil from us, then we will, surely, follow guidance.' <BR>50. But when WE 
      removed the punishment from them, behold ! they broke their pledge. 
      <BR>51. And Pharaoh made a proclamation among his people: `O my people ! 
      does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me and these streams flowing 
      beneath me ? Do you not then see ? <BR>52. `Nay, I am better than this 
      despicable fellow who can scarcely express himself clearly. <BR>53. `And 
      why have not bracelets of gold bestowed on him, or angels accompanied him 
      in serried ranks ?' <BR>54. Thus did he make light of his people, and they 
      obeyed him. Indeed, they were a wicked people. <BR>55. So, when they 
      exited Our anger, WE took vengeance upon them, and drowned them all. 
      <BR>56. And WE made them a precedent, and an example for the coming 
      generations. <BR>57. And when the son of Mary is mentioned as an example, 
      lo ! thy people raise a clamour thereat; <BR>58. And they say, `Are our 
      gods better, or he ?' They mention not this to thee but for the sake of 
      disputation. Nay, but they are a contentious people. <BR>59. He was only 
      Our servant, on whom WE bestowed Our favour, and WE made him an Example 
      for the children of Israel. <BR>60. And if WE so willed, WE could make 
      from among you angels to be your successors in the 
  earth.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
