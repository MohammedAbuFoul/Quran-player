    <TD>67. HE it is Who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then 
      from a clot; then HE brings you forth as a child; then HE lets you grow, 
      so that you attain your full strength; and afterward become old - though 
      some among you are caused to die before - and that you may reach a term 
      appointed and that you may learn wisdom. <BR>68. HE it is Who gives life 
      and causes death. And when HE decrees a thing, HE says concerning it, `Be 
      !' and it becomes into being. <BR>69. Seest thou not those who dispute 
      concerning the Signs of ALLAH ? How they are being turned away from the 
      truth ! <BR>70. Those who reject the Book and that with which WE sent Our 
      Messengers. But soon will they come to know, <BR>71. When the iron-collars 
      will be round their necks, and chains too. And they will be dragged 
      <BR>72. Into boiling water; then in the Fire will they be burnt. <BR>73. 
      Then it will be said to them, `Where are those who were your associate 
      gods <BR>74. `Beside ALLAH ?' They will say, `They have vanished away from 
      us. Nay, we never prayed to anything beside ALLAH before.' Thus will ALLAH 
      confound the disbelievers. <BR>75. That is because you exulted in the 
      earth without justification, and because you behaved insolently. <BR>76. 
      Enter ye the gates of Hell, to abide therein. And evil is the abode of the 
      arrogant. <BR>77. So be thou patient. Surely, the promise of ALLAH is 
      bound to be fulfilled. And whether WE show thee in this life part of what 
      WE have promised them or whether WE cause thee to die before the 
      fulfillment of Our promise, to Us will they be brought 
  back.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
