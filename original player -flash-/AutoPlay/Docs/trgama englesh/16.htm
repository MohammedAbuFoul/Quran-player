    <TD>102. And they pursue the course which was pursued by the rebellious 
      men against the Kingdom of Solomon. And Solomon did not disbelieve; but it 
      was the rebellious ones who disbelieved. They taught people falsehood and 
      deception, and they claim that they follow what was revealed to the two 
      angels in Babylon, Har&#1618;t and Mar&#1618;t. But these two taught no one anything 
      until they had said, `We are but a trial from ALLAH, do not, therefore, 
      reject what we say.' So men learnt from them that by which they made a 
      distinction between man and his wife, but they harmed no one thereby, 
      except by the command of ALLAH; on the contrary, these people (the 
      opponents of the Holy Prophet) are learning that which would harm them and 
      do them no good. And they have certainly known that he who traffics 
      therein has no share of good in the Hereafter; and surely evil is that for 
      which they sold their souls; if only they knew. <BR>103. And if they had 
      believed and acted righteously, better surely, would have been their 
      reward from ALLAH, if only they knew. <BR>104. O ye who believe, say not 
      to the Prophet `Ra'ina,' but say `Unzurna' and hearken unto him. And for 
      the disbelievers is a painful punishment. <BR>105. They who disbelieve 
      from among the people of the Book, or from among those who associate gods 
      with ALLAH, desire not that any good should be sent down to you from your 
      Lord; but ALLAH chooses for HIS mercy whomsoever HE pleases; and ALLAH is 
      Lord of exceeding bounty. &nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
