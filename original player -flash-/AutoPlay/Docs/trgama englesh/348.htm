    <TD>90. Yea, WE have brought them the truth, and they are certainly liars. 
      <BR>91. ALLAH has not taken unto Himself any son, nor is there any other 
      god along with HIM; in that case each god would have taken away what he 
      had created, and some of them would, surely, have sought domination over 
      others. Glorified be ALLAH far above that which they allege; <BR>92. 
      Knower alike of the unseen and of the seen. Exalted is HE above all that 
      which they associate with HIM ! <BR>93. Say, `My Lord, if Thou wilt show 
      me that which they are promised; <BR>94. `My Lord, then place me not with 
      the wrongdoing people.' <BR>95. And certainly WE have the power to show 
      thee that which WE have promised them. <BR>96. Repel evil with that which 
      is best. WE know very well what they allege. <BR>97. And say, `My Lord, I 
      seek refuge in Thee from the incitements of the evil ones; <BR>98. `And I 
      seek refuge in Thee, my Lord, lest they should come near me.' <BR>99. 
      Until, when death comes to one of them, he says entreating repeatedly, `My 
      Lord send me back, <BR>100. That I may do righteous deeds in the life that 
      I have left behind.' That cannot be ! It is only a word that he utters. 
      And behind them is a barrier until the day when they shall be raised 
      again. <BR>101. And when the trumpet is blown, there will be no ties of 
      relationship any more between them on that day, nor will they ask after 
      one another. <BR>102. Then those whose scales are heavy - these will be 
      prosperous; <BR>103. But those whose scales are light - these are they who 
      will have ruined their souls; in Hell will they abide. <BR>104. The fire 
      will scorch their faces and they will grin with fear 
  therein.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
