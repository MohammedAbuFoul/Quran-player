    <TD>56. The Kingdom on that day shall be ALLAH's. HE will judge between 
      them. So those who believe and do righteous deed will be in Gardens of 
      Bliss; <BR>57. But those, who disbelieve and reject OUR Signs, will have 
      an humiliating Punishment. <BR>58. And those who leave their homes for the 
      cause of ALLAH, and are then slain or die, ALLAH will, surely, provide for 
      them a goodly provision. And, surely, ALLAH is the Best of providers. 
      <BR>59. HE will, surely, admit them to a place with which they will be 
      well-pleased. And ALLAH is indeed All-Knowing, Forbearing. <BR>60. That 
      indeed is so. And whoso retaliates with the like of that with which he is 
      afflicted and is then transgressed against, ALLAH will surely help him. 
      ALLAH is indeed the Effacer of sins and is Most Forgiving. <BR>61. That 
      system of punishment operates to show that it is ALLAH Who causes the 
      night to enter into the day and causes the day to enter into the night, 
      and that ALLAH is All-Hearing, All-Seeing, <BR>62. And that is because it 
      is ALLAH WHO is the Truth, and that which they call on beside HIM is 
      falsehood and because ALLAH is the High, the Great. <BR>63. Seest thou not 
      that ALLAH sends down water from the sky and the earth becomes green ? 
      ALLAH is indeed the Knower of the subtleties, the All-Aware. <BR>64. To 
      him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And 
      Surely ALLAH is Self-Sufficient, 
Praiseworthy.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
