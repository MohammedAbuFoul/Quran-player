    <TD>15. `Is this then magic, or do you still not see ? <BR>16. `Burn ye 
      therein; and whether you show patience or you show it not, it will be the 
      same for you. You are requited only for what you used to do.' <BR>17. 
      Verily, the righteous will, surely, be in Gardens and in bliss, <BR>18. 
      Rejoicing in what their Lord will have bestowed on them; and their Lord 
      will save them from the torment of the Fire, <BR>19. And HE will say to 
      them, `Eat and drink with happy enjoyment because of what you used to do.' 
      <BR>20. On that day they will be reclining on couches arranged in rows. 
      And WE shall give them as companions fair maidens, having wide, beautiful 
      eyes. <BR>21. And those who believe and whose children follow them in 
      faith - with them will WE join their children. And WE will not diminish 
      anything from the reward of their works. Every man stands pledged for what 
      he has earned. <BR>22. And WE shall bestow upon them every kind of fruit 
      and meat such as they will wish for. <BR>23. There they will pass from one 
      to another a cup wherein is neither levity nor sin. <BR>24. And there will 
      wait upon them youths of their own, pure as though they were pearls well 
      preserved. <BR>25. And they will turn one to another, asking questions. 
      <BR>26. They will say, `Before this, when we were among our families, we 
      were very much afraid of ALLAH's judgment; <BR>27. `But ALLAH has been 
      gracious unto us and has saved us from the torment of the scorching blast; 
      <BR>28. `We used to pray to HIM before. Surely, HE is the Beneficent, the 
      Merciful.' <BR>29. So keep on admonishing. By the grace of thy Lord thou 
      art neither a soothsayer, nor a madman. <BR>30. Do they say `He is a poet; 
      we are waiting for some calamity which time will bring upon him ?' <BR>31. 
      Say, `Await ye then, I am, too, with you among those who are 
    waiting.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
