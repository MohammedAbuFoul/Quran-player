    <TD>246. Hast thou not heard of the chiefs of the Children of Israel after 
      Moses, when they said to a Prophet of theirs, `Appoint for us a king that 
      we may fight in the way of ALLAH ?' He said, `It is not likely that you 
      will not fight, if fighting is prescribe for you ?' They said, `What 
      reason have we that we should not fight in the way of ALLAH when we have 
      been driven forth from our homes and our sons ?' But when fighting was 
      ordained for them, they turned back except a small number of them. And 
      ALLAH knows the transgressors well.<BR>247. And their Prophet said to 
      them, `ALLAH has appointed for you Talut as king.' They said, `How can he 
      have sovereignty over us while we are better entitled to sovereignty than 
      he, and he is not given abundance of wealth ?' He said, `Surely, ALLAH has 
      chosen him above you and has bestowed upon him abundant increase in 
      knowledge and in strength of body. And ALLAH gives sovereignty to whom HE 
      pleases. And ALLAH is Bountiful, All-Knowing. <BR>248. And their Prophet 
      said to them, `The sign of his sovereignty is that there shall be given 
      you a heart wherein there will be tranquility from your Lord and a legacy 
      of good left by the family of Moses and the family of Aaron - the angels 
      bearing it. Surely, in this there is a sign for you if you are 
    believers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
