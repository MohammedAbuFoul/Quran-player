          <TD>29. Muhammad is the Messenger of ALLAH. And those who are with 
            him are hard against the disbelievers but tender among themselves. 
            Thou seest them bowing and prostrating themselves in Prayer, seeking 
            ALLAH's grace and pleasure. Their marks are upon their faces, being 
            the traces of prostrations. This is their description in the Torah. 
            And their description in the Gospel is like unto a seed-produce that 
            sends forth its sprout, then makes it strong; it then becomes stout, 
            and stands firm on its stem, delighting the sowers - That HE may 
            cause the disbelievers to boil with rage at the sight of them. ALLAH 
            has promised, unto those of them, who believe and do good works, 
            forgiveness and a great reward. <BR>&nbsp;

            1. O ye who believe ! be not forward in the presence of ALLAH and 
            HIS Messenger, but fear ALLAH. Verily, ALLAH is All-Hearing, 
            All-Knowing. <BR>2. O ye who believe ! raise not your voices above 
            the voice of the Prophet, nor speak loudly to him as you speak 
            loudly to one another, lest your works come to naught while you 
            perceive not. <BR>3. Verily, those who lower their voices in the 
            presence of the Messenger of ALLAH - those are they whose hearts 
            ALLAH has purified for righteousness. For them is forgiveness and a 
            great reward. <BR>4. Those who call out to thee from without thy 
            private apartments - most of them have no 
      sense.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
