    <TD>92. It does not behove a believer to slay a believer unless it be by 
      mistake. And he who slays a believer by mistake shall free a believing 
      slave, and pay blood-money to be handed over to his heirs, unless they 
      remit it as charity. But if the person slain be of a people hostile to 
      you, and he is a believer, then the penalty is only the freeing of a 
      believing slave, and if he be of a people between whom and you is a pact, 
      then the penalty is blood-money to be handed over to his heirs, and the 
      freeing of a believing slave. But whoso finds not one, then he shall fast 
      for two consecutive months - a mercy from ALLAH. And ALLAH is All-Knowing, 
      Wise. <BR>93. And whoso slays a believer intentionally, his reward shall 
      be Hell wherein he shall abide. And ALLAH shall be wroth with him and 
      shall curse him and shall prepare for him a great punishment. <BR>94. O ye 
      who believe ! when you go forth to fight in the cause of ALLAH, make 
      proper investigation and say not to anyone who greets you with the 
      greeting of peace, Thou art not a believer.' You seek the goods of this 
      life, but with ALLAH are good things in plenty. Such were you before this, 
      but ALLAH conferred His special favour on you; so do make proper 
      investigation. Surely, ALLAH is Aware of what you 
do.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
