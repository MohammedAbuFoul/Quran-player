    <TD>1. By the heaven having mansions of stars, <BR>2. And the Promised 
      Day, <BR>3. And the witness and he to whom witness is borne, <BR>4. Cursed 
      be the Fellows of the Trench - <BR>5. The Fire fed with fuel - <BR>6. And 
      they were the witnesses of what they did to the believers. <BR>7. And they 
      hated them not but only because they believed in ALLAH, the Almighty, the 
      Praiseworthy, <BR>8. To Whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the 
      earth; and ALLAH is Witness over all things. <BR>9. To Whom belongs the 
      Kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and ALLAH is Witness over all 
      things. <BR>10. Those who persecute the believing men and the believing 
      women and then repent not, for them is, surely, the punishment of Hell, 
      and for them is the torment of heart-burning. <BR>11. But those who 
      believe and do good works, for them are Gardens through streams flow. That 
      is, indeed, the supreme achievement. <BR>12. Surely, the seizing of thy 
      Lord is severe. <BR>13. HE it is Who originates and reproduces, <BR>14. 
      And HE is the Most Forgiving, the Loving; <BR>15. The Lord of the Throne, 
      the Lord of Honour; <BR>16. Doer of what HE wills. <BR>17. Has not the 
      story of the Hosts come to thee ? <BR>18. Of Pharaoh and Thamud ? <BR>19. 
      Nay, but those who disbelieve persist in rejecting the truth. <BR>20. And 
      ALLAH encompasses them from before them and from behind them. <BR>21. Nay, 
      but it is a glorious Qur'an. <BR>22. In a well-guarded 
  tablet.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
