    <TD>220. - Upon this world and the next. And they ask thee concerning the 
      orphans. Say `Promotion of their welfare is an act of great goodness. And 
      if you intermix with them, they are your brethren. And ALLAH knows him who 
      seeks to make mischief apart from him who seeks to promote the welfare of 
      the orphans. And if ALLAH had so willed, HE would have put you to 
      hardship. Surely ALLAH is Mighty and Wise.' <BR>221. And marry not 
      idolatrous women until they believe; even a believing bond women is better 
      than an idolatress, although she may please you. And give not believing 
      women in marriage to idolaters until they believe; even a believing slave 
      is better than an idolater, although he may please you. These call to 
      Fire, but ALLAH calls to Heaven and to forgiveness by HIS will. And HE 
      makes HIS Signs clear to the people that they may remember. <BR>222. And 
      they ask thee concerning menstruation. Say, `It is a harmful thing, so 
      keep away from women during menstruation, and go not in unto them until 
      they are clean. But when they have cleansed themselves, go in unto them as 
      ALLAH has commanded you. ALLAH loves those who keep themselves clean.' 
      <BR>223. Your wives are a sort of tilth for you; so approach your tilth 
      when and as you like and send ahead some good for yourselves; and fear 
      ALLAH and know that you shall meet HIM; and bear good tidings to those who 
      believe. <BR>224. And make not ALLAH a target for your oaths that you may 
      thereby abstain from doing good and acting righteously and making peace 
      between men. And ALLAH is All-Hearing, 
All-Knowing.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
