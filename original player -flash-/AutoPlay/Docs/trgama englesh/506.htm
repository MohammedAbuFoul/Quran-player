    <TD>29. And call to mind when WE turned towards thee a party of jinn who 
      wished to hear the Qur'an and, when they were present at its recitation, 
      they said to one another, `Be silent and listen,' and when it was 
      finished, they went back to their people, warning them. <BR>30. They said, 
      `O our people, we have heard a Book, which have been sent down after 
      Moses, fulfilling that which is before it; it guides to the truth and to 
      the right path; <BR>31. `O our people, respond to ALLAH's summoner and 
      believe in HIM. HE will forgive you your sins, and protect you from a 
      painful punishment, <BR>32. `And whoso does not respond to ALLAH's 
      summoner, he cannot escape HIM in the earth, nor can he have any protector 
      beside HIM. Such are in Manifest error.' <BR>33. Do they not realize that 
      ALLAH, Who created the heavens and the earth and was not wearied by their 
      creation, has the power to bring the dead to life ? Yea, verily, HE has 
      the power over all things. <BR>34. And on the day when those who 
      disbelieve will be brought before the Fire, it will be said to them, `Is 
      not this the truth ?' They will say, `Aye, by our Lord, it is the truth.' 
      He will say, `Then taste the punishment, because you disbelieved.' <BR>35. 
      Have patience, then, as the Messengers, possessed of high resolve, had 
      patience; and be in no haste concerning them. On the day when they see 
      that which they are threatened, it will appear to them as though they had 
      not tarried in this world save for an hour of a day. This warning has been 
      conveyed; and none but the disobedient people shall be 
  destroyed.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
