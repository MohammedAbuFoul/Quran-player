    <TD>65. Seest thou not that ALLAH has subjected to you whatever is in the 
      earth, and the ships that sail through the sea by HIS command ? And HE 
      holds back the heaven lest it should fall on the earth save by HIS leave. 
      Surely, ALLAH is compassionate and Merciful to people.<BR>66. And HE it is 
      who gave you life, then HE will cause you to die, then HE will give you 
      life again. Surely, man is most ungrateful. <BR>67. For every people WE 
      have appointed ways of worship which they observe; so let them not dispute 
      with thee in the matter of the Islamic way of worship; and call thou the 
      people to thy Lord, for, surely, thou art on the right guidance. <BR>68. 
      And if they contend with thee, say, `ALLAH knows best what you do; <BR>69. 
      `ALLAH will judge between you and me on the Day of Resurrection concerning 
      that about which you differ.' <BR>70. Knowest thou not that ALLAH knows 
      whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth ? Surely, it is all preserved 
      in a Book, and that is easy for ALLAH. <BR>71. And they worship instead of 
      ALLAH that for which HE has sent down no authority, and that of which they 
      have no knowledge. And for the wrongdoers there is no helper. <BR>72. And 
      when Our clear Signs are recited unto them, thou seest on the faces of 
      those who disbelieve, manifest signs of displeasure. They would well-nigh 
      attack those who recite Our Signs to them. Say, `Shall I tell you of 
      something worse than that ? It is the Fire ! ALLAH has promised it to 
      those who disbelieve. And an evil destination it is 
!'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
