    <TD>1. Alif, Lam, Mim. <BR>2. ALLAH is HE besides Whom there is none 
      worthy of worship, the Living, the Self-Subsisting and All-Sustaining. 
      <BR>3. HE has sent down to thee the Book containing the truth and 
      fulfilling that which precedes it; and HE has sent down the Torah and the 
      Gospel before this, as a guidance to the people; and HE has sent down the 
      Discrimination. <BR>4. Surely, those who deny the Signs of ALLAH, shall 
      have a severe punishment. And ALLAH is Mighty, Lord of Retribution. <BR>5. 
      Surely, nothing in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from ALLAH. <BR>6. 
      HE it is who fashions you in the wombs as HE wills; there is none worthy 
      of worship but HE, the Mighty, the Wise. <BR>7. HE it is who has sent down 
      to thee the Book; in it there are verses that are firm and decisive in 
      meaning - they are the basis of the Book - and there are others that are 
      susceptible of different interpretations. But those in whose hearts is 
      perversity pursue such thereof as are susceptible of different 
      interpretations, seeking to cause discord and seeking wrong 
      interpretations of it. And none knows it except ALLAH and those who are 
      firmly grounded in knowledge; they say, `We believe in it; the whole is 
      from our Lord.' - And none take heed except those gifted with 
      understanding - <BR>8. `Our Lord, let not our hearts become perverse after 
      Thou hast guided us, and bestow on us mercy from Thyself; surely Thou art 
      the Great Bestower; <BR>9. `Our Lord, Thou wilt certainly assemble mankind 
      together on the Day about which there is no doubt; surely, ALLAH never 
      fails in HIS promise.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
