    <TD>238. Watch over prayers, and particularly the middle prayer, and stand 
      before ALLAH submissively.<BR>239. If you are in a state of fear, then say 
      your prayers on foot or riding, but when you are safe, remember ALLAH as 
      HE has taught you that which you did not know. <BR>240. And those of you 
      who die and leave behind wives shall bequeath to their wives provision for 
      a year without being turned out. But if they themselves go out, then there 
      shall be no blame upon you in regard to any proper thing which they do 
      concerning themselves. And ALLAH is Mighty and Wise.<BR>241. And for the 
      divorce women also there should be a provision according to what is fair - 
      an obligation on the God-fearing. <BR>242. Thus does ALLAH make HIS 
      commandments clear to you that you may understand. <BR>243. Hast thou not 
      heard of those who went forth from their homes, and they were thousands, 
      fearing death ? And ALLAH said to them, `Die', Then HE brought them to 
      life. Surely ALLAH is Gracious to men, but most men are not grateful. 
      <BR>244. And fight in the cause of ALLAH and know that ALLAH is 
      All-Hearing, All-Knowing. <BR>245. Who is it that will lend ALLAH a goodly 
      loan that HE may multiply it for him manifold ? And ALLAH receives and 
      enlarges. And to HIM shall you be made to 
return.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
