    <TD>69. Even as those before you - they were mighty than you in power and 
      had more wealth and children. They enjoyed their lot for a time, so have 
      you enjoyed your lot as those before you enjoyed their lot. And you 
      indulge in idle talk. It is they whose works shall be of no avail in this 
      world and the Hereafter. And it is they who are the losers. <BR>70. Has 
      not the news reached them of those before them - the people of Noah, and 
      Ad, and Thamud, and the people of Abraham, and the dwellers of Midian, and 
      the cities which were overthrown ? Their Messengers came to them with 
      clear Signs. So ALLAH wronged them not, but they wronged themselves. 
      <BR>71. And the believers, men and women, are friends of another. They 
      enjoined good and forbid evil and observe Prayer and pay the Zakaat and 
      obey ALLAH and HIS Messenger. It is these on whom ALLAH will have mercy. 
      Surely, ALLAH is Mighty and Wise. <BR>72. ALLAH has promised to believers, 
      men and women, Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will 
      abide, and delightful dwelling-places in Gardens of Eternity. And the 
      pleasure of ALLAH is the greatest of all. That is the supreme 
    triumph.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
