    <TD>32. Does their reason enjoin this upon them or are they a rebellious 
      people ? <BR>33. Do they say, `He has forged it ?' Nay, but they have no 
      faith. <BR>34. Let them, then produce a discourse like this, if they speak 
      the truth. <BR>35. Have they been created without a purpose, or are they 
      themselves the creators ? <BR>36. Did they create the heavens and the 
      earth ? Nay, but they have no faith in the Creator. <BR>37. Do they have 
      the treasures of thy Lord with them, or are they the guardians thereof ? 
      <BR>38. Have they a ladder by means of which they can ascend into heaven 
      and overhear the Divine words ? Then let their listener bring a manifest 
      proof. <BR>39. Has HE only daughters and you have sons ? <BR>40. Dost thou 
      ask a reward from them, so that they are weighed down with a load of debt 
      ? <BR>41. Do they possess knowledge of the unseen, so that they write it 
      down ? <BR>42. Do they intend to devise a plot ? But the disbelievers 
      themselves will be the victims of their plot. <BR>43. Have they a god 
      other than ALLAH ? Exalted is ALLAH above all that which they associate 
      with HIM. <BR>44. And if they should see a fragment of the sky falling 
      down, they would say, just clouds piled up. <BR>45. So leave them until 
      they meet that day of theirs, on which they will be thunder-struck; 
      <BR>46. The day when their scheming shall avail them naught, nor shall 
      they be helped. <BR>47. And, verily, for those, who do wrong, there is a 
      punishment besides that. But most of them know not. <BR>48. So wait 
      patiently for the judgment of thy Lord; for, assuredly, thou art before 
      Our eyes; and celebrate the praises of thy Lord when thou risest up for 
      prayer, <BR>49. And for part of the night also do thou glorify HIM and at 
      the setting of the stars.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
