    <TD>147. But if they accuse thee of falsehood, say, `Your Lord is the Lord 
      of all-embracing mercy, and HIS wrath shall not be turned back from the 
      guilty people.' <BR>148. Those who associate gods with ALLAH will say, `If 
      ALLAH had pleased, we would not have associated gods with HIM, nor would 
      our fathers, nor would we have made anything unlawful.' In the like manner 
      did those who were before them accuse God's Messengers of falsehood, until 
      they tasted OUR wrath. Say, `Have you any knowledge ? Then produce it for 
      us. You only follow mere conjecture. And you only tell lies.' <BR>149. 
      Say, `ALLAH's is the argument that reaches home. If HE had enforced HIS 
      Will, HE would have surely guided you all.' <BR>150. Say, `Produce your 
      witnesses who testify that ALLAH has forbidden this.' If they bear 
      witness, bear thou not witness with them, nor follow thou the evil desires 
      of those who treat OUR Signs as lies and those who believe not in the 
      Hereafter and who set up equals to their Lord. <BR>151. Say, `I will 
      recite to you what your Lord has forbidden, that you associate not 
      anything as partner with HIM; and that you do good to parents, and that 
      you slay not your children for fear of poverty - it is WE who provide for 
      you and for them - and that you approach not foul deeds, whether open or 
      secret; and that you slay not the soul the slaying of which ALLAH has 
      forbidden, save in accordance with the demands of justice. That is what HE 
      has enjoined upon you, that you may 
understand.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
