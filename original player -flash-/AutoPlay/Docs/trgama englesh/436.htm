    <TD>12. And the two seas are not alike: this one palatable, sweet and 
      pleasant to drink and this other saltish, bitter. And yet from each you 
      eat fresh meat, and take forth ornaments which you wear. And thou seest 
      the ships therein ploughing the waves that you may seek of HIS bounty, and 
      that you may be grateful. <BR>13. HE merges the night into the day, and HE 
      merges the day into the night. And HE has pressed into service the sun and 
      the moon, each runs its course to an appointed term. Such is ALLAH, your 
      Lord; His is the Kingdom, and those whom you call upon beside ALLAH own 
      not even a whit. <BR>14. If you call on them, they will not hear your 
      call; and even if they heard it, they could not answer you. And on the Day 
      of Resurrection they will deny your having associated them with ALLAH. And 
      none can inform thee like the One Who is All-Aware. <BR>15. O men, it is 
      you who are dependent upon ALLAH, but ALLAH is HE Who is Self-Sufficient, 
      the Praiseworthy. <BR>16. If HE please, HE could destroy you, and bring a 
      new creation instead. <BR>17. And that is not at all difficult for ALLAH. 
      <BR>18. And no burdened soul can bear the burden of another; and if a 
      heavily laden soul call another to bear its load, naught of it shall be 
      carried by the other, even though he be a kinsman. Thou canst warn only 
      those who fear their Lord in secret and observe Prayer, And whoso purifies 
      himself, purifies himself only to his own good; and to ALLAH shall be the 
      return.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
