    <TD>99. Thus do WE relate to thee the tidings of what has happened before. 
      And WE have given thee from US a Reminder. <BR>100. Whoso turns away from 
      it, he will surely bear a heavy burden on the Day of Resurrection. 
      <BR>101. Abiding thereunder, and evil will the burden be to them on the 
      Day of Resurrection. <BR>102. The day when the trumpet will be blown. And 
      on that day WE shall gather the sinful together, blue-eyed. <BR>103. They 
      will talk to one another in a low tone saying, `You tarried only ten 
      days.' <BR>104. WE know best what they will say - when the one most 
      upright in conduct among them will say, `You have tarried only a day.' 
      <BR>105. And they ask thee concerning the mountains. Say, `My Lord will 
      break them into pieces and scatter them as dust; <BR>106. `And HE will 
      leave them a barren level plain; <BR>107. `Wherein thou wilt see no 
      depression or elevation. <BR>108. On that day they will follow the Caller 
      in whose teaching is no crookedness; and all voices shall be hushed before 
      the Gracious God and thou shalt not hear but a subdued murmur. <BR>109. On 
      that day intercession shall not avail save the intercession of him whom 
      the Gracious God grants permission and with whose word of faith HE is 
      pleased. <BR>110. HE knows all that is before them and all that is behind 
      them, but they cannot compass it with their knowledge. <BR>111. And all 
      great leaders shall humble themselves before the Living, Self-Subsisting 
      and All-Sustaining God. And HE indeed is undone who bears the burden of 
      iniquity. <BR>112. But he who does good works, being a believer, shall 
      apprehend neither injustice nor loss. <BR>113. And thus have WE sent it 
      down - the Qur'an in Arabic -and WE have explained therein every kind of 
      warning, that they may fear God or that it may cause them to remember 
    him.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
