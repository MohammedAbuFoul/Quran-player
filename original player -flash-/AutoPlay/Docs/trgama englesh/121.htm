    <TD>77. Say, `O People of the Book, exceed not the limits in the matter of 
      your religion unjustly, nor follow the low desires of a people who went 
      astray before and caused many to go astray, and who have strayed away from 
      the right path.' <BR>78. Those amongst the Israel who disbelieved were 
      cursed by the tongue of David, and of Jesus, son of Mary. That was because 
      they disobeyed and used to transgress. <BR>79. They did not restrain one 
      another from the iniquity which they committed. Evil indeed was what they 
      used to do. <BR>80. Thou shalt see many of them making friends with those 
      who disbelieve. Surely, evil is that which their souls have sent on before 
      for themselves so that ALLAH is displeased with them; and in this 
      punishment they shall abide. <BR>81. And if they had believed in ALLAH and 
      this Prophet, and that which has been revealed to him, they would not have 
      taken them for their friends, but many of them are transgressors. <BR>82. 
      Thou shalt certainly find the Jews and those who associate partners with 
      ALLAH to be the most vehement of men in enmity against the believers. And 
      thou shalt assuredly find those who say, `We are Christians,' to be the 
      nearest of them in friendship to the believers. That is because among them 
      are savants and monks and because they are not 
  arrogant.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
