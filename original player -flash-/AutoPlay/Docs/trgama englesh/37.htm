    <TD>231. And when you divorce women and they approach the end of their 
      appointed period, then either retain them in a becoming manner or send 
      them away in a becoming manner; but retain them not wrongfully so that you 
      may transgress against them. And whoso does that, surely wrongs his own 
      soul. And do not make a jest of the commandments of ALLAH, and remember 
      the favour of ALLAH upon you and the book and the Wisdom which HE has sent 
      down to you, whereby HE exhorts you. And fear ALLAH and know that ALLAH 
      knows all things well<BR>232. And when you divorce women and they reach 
      the end of their period, prevent them not from marrying their husbands, if 
      they agree between themselves in a decent manner. This an admonition for 
      him among you who believes in ALLAH and the Last Day. It is more blessed 
      for you and purer; and ALLAH knows but you know not. <BR>233. And mothers 
      shall give suck to their children for two whole years; this is for those 
      who desire to complete the period of suckling. And the man to whom the 
      child belongs shall be responsible for their (the mothers') maintenance 
      and clothing according to usage. No soul is burdened beyond its capacity. 
      Neither shall a mother be made to suffer on account of her child, nor 
      shall he to whom the child belongs be made to suffer on account of his 
      child and the same is incumbent on the father's heir. If they both decide 
      upon weaning the child by mutual consent and consultation, there is no 
      blame on them. And if you desire to engage a wet-nurse for your children, 
      there shall be no blame on you, provided you pay what you have agreed to 
      pay in a fair manner. And fear ALLAH and know that ALLAH sees what you 
    do&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
