    <TD>96. And when the bearer of glad tidings came, he laid the shirt before 
      him and he became enlightened. Then he said, `Did I not say to you, `I 
      know from ALLAH what you know not ?' <BR>97. They said, `O our father, ask 
      of ALLAH forgiveness of our sins for us; we have indeed been sinners.' 
      <BR>98. He said, `I will certainly ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. 
      Surely HE is the Most Forgiving, the Merciful. <BR>99. And when they came 
      to Joseph, he put up his parents with himself and said, `Enter Egypt in 
      peace, if it please ALLAH.' <BR>100. And he raised his parents upon the 
      throne and they all fell down prostrate before ALLAH for him. And he said, 
      `O my father, this is the fulfillment of my dream of old. My Lord has made 
      it come true. And he bestowed a favour upon me when he took me out of the 
      prison and brought you from the desert after Satan had stirred up discord 
      between me and my brethren. Surely, my Lord is Benignant to whomsoever HE 
      pleases; for HE is the All-Knowing, the Wise. <BR>101. `O my Lord, Thou 
      hast bestowed a portion of sovereignty upon me and taught me the 
      interpretations of dreams. O Maker of the heavens and the earth, Thou art 
      my Protector in this world and in the Hereafter. Let death come to me in a 
      state of submission to Thy Will and join me to the righteous.' <BR>102. 
      That is of the tidings of the unseen, which WE reveal to thee. And thou 
      wast not with them when they agreed upon their plan while they were 
      plotting. <BR>103. And most men will not believe even though eagerly 
      desire it.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
