    <TD>7. And as to those who believe and do righteous deeds WE shall surely, 
      remove from them their evils, and WE shall, surely, give them the best 
      reward of their works. <BR>8. And WE have enjoined on man kindness to his 
      parents; but if they contend with thee to make thee associate that with ME 
      of which thou hast no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto ME is your 
      return, and I shall inform you of what you did. <BR>9. And those who 
      believe and do righteous deeds - them WE shall, surely, admit into the 
      company of the righteous. <BR>10. And of men there are some who say, `We 
      believe in ALLAH;' but when they are made to suffer in the cause of ALLAH, 
      they regard the persecution of men as if it were the punishment of ALLAH. 
      And if help comes from thy Lord, they are sure to say, `Certainly, we were 
      with you.' Is not ALLAH best aware of what is in the breasts of HIS 
      creatures ? <BR>11. And ALLAH will, certainly, make manifest those who 
      believe and HE will, surely, distinguish the hypocrites from the believers 
      <BR>12. And those who disbelieve say to those who believe, `Follow our 
      way, and we will, surely, bear the burden of your sins.' But they will 
      bear none of the burden of their sins. They are, surely, liars. <BR>13. 
      But they shall, surely, bear their own burdens, and other burdens along 
      with their own burdens. And they will, surely, be questioned on the Day of 
      Resurrection concerning that which they fabricated. <BR>14. And WE, 
      certainly, sent Noah to his people, and he remained among them a thousand 
      years, short of fifty years. Then the deluge overtook them, while they 
      were wrongdoers.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
