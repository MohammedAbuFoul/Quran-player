    <TD>38. HE will say, `Enter ye into the Fire among the nations of jinn and 
      men who passed away before you.' Everytime a nation enters, it shall curse 
      its sister nation until, when they have all successively arrived therein, 
      the last of them will say with regard to the first of them, `Our Lord, 
      these lead us astray, so give them a double punishment, but you do not 
      know.' <BR>39. And the first of them will say to the last of them, `You 
      have no superiority over us; taste, therefore, the punishment for all that 
      you did. <BR>40. Those who reject OUR Signs and turn away from them with 
      disdain, the gates of spiritual firmament will not be opened for them, nor 
      will they enter Heaven until a camel goes through the eye of a needle. And 
      thus do WE requite the offenders. <BR>41. They shall have a bed of Hell 
      and over them coverings of the same. And thus do WE requite the unjust. 
      <BR>42. But as to those who believe and do good works - and WE charge not 
      any soul beyond its capacity - these are the inmates of Heaven; they shall 
      abide therein. <BR>43. And WE shall remove whatever rancour may be in 
      their hearts. Beneath them shall flow rivers. And they shall say, `All 
      praise belongs to ALLAH who has guided us to this paradise. And we could 
      not have found guidance, if ALLAH had not guided us. The Messengers of our 
      Lord did indeed bring the truth.' And it shall be proclaimed unto them, 
      `This is the heaven to which you have been made heirs as a reward for what 
      you did.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
