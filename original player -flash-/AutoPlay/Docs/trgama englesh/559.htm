    <TD>6. Lodge the divorced women during the prescribed period in the houses 
      wherein you dwell, according to your means, and harass them not that you 
      may create hardships for them and thus force them to leave. And if they be 
      with child, spend on them until they are delivered of their burden. And if 
      they give suck to the child for you, give them their due recompense, to be 
      fixed in consultation with one another according to what is customary; but 
      if you meet with difficulty from each other, then let another women suckle 
      the child for the father. <BR>7. Let him who has abundance of means spend 
      out of his abundance. And let him whose means of subsistence are 
      straitened spend out of what ALLAH has given him. ALLAH burdens not any 
      soul beyond that which HE has bestowed upon it. ALLAH will soon bring 
      about ease after hardship. <BR>8. How many a city rebelled against the 
      command of its Lord and HIS Messengers, and WE called it to severe account 
      and punished it with dire punishment ! <BR>9. So it tasted the evil 
      consequences of its conduct, and the send of its affair was ruin. <BR>10. 
      ALLAH has prepared for them a severe punishment; so fear ALLAH, O ye men 
      of understanding who have believed. ALLAH has, indeed, sent down to you a 
      Reminder <BR>11. A Messenger, who recites unto you the clear Signs of 
      ALLAH, that HE may bring those who believe and do good deeds out of every 
      kind of darkness into light. And whoso believes in ALLAH and does 
      righteous deeds - HE will make him enter Gardens, through which streams 
      flow, to abide therein for ever. ALLAH has, indeed, made excellent 
      provision for him. <BR>12. ALLAH is HE who created seven heavens, and of 
      the earth the like thereof. The Divine command comes down in their midst, 
      that you may know that ALLAH has power over all things, and that ALLAH 
      encompasses all things in HIS 
knowledge.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
