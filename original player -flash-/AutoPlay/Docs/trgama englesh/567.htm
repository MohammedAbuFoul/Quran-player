    <TD>9. And Pharaoh and those who were before him, and the overthrown 
      cities persistently committed sins. <BR>10. They disobeyed the Messenger 
      of their Lord, therefore, HE seized them - a severe seizing. <BR>11. 
      Verily, when the waters rose high, WE bore you in the boat, <BR>12. That 
      WE might make it a reminder for you, and that retaining ears might retain 
      it. <BR>13. So that when a single blast is sounded on the trumpet, <BR>14. 
      And the earth and the mountains are heaved up and then are crushed in a 
      single crash, , <BR>15. On that day will the Great Event come to pass. 
      <BR>16. And the heaven will cleave asunder, and it will be very frail that 
      day. <BR>17. And the angels will be standing on its borders, and above 
      them on that day eight angels will bear the Throne of thy Lord. <BR>18. On 
      that day you will be presented before God; and none of your secrets will 
      remain hidden. <BR>19. Then, as for him who is given his record in his 
      right hand, he will say, `Come, read my record.' <BR>20. `Surely, I knew 
      that I would meet my reckoning.' <BR>21. So he will enjoy a delightful 
      life, <BR>22. In a lofty Garden, <BR>23. Whereof clusters of fruit will be 
      within easy reach. <BR>24. It will be said to him, `Eat and drink joyfully 
      because of the good deeds you did in the days gone by.' <BR>25. But as for 
      him who is given his record in his left hand, he will say, `O, would that 
      I had not been given my record ! <BR>26. `Nor known what my reckoning was 
      ! <BR>27. `O, would that death had made an end of me ! <BR>28. `My wealth 
      has been of no avail to me ! <BR>29. `My authority is gone from me.' 
      <BR>30. The angels will be commanded: `Seize him and fetter him, <BR>31. 
      `Then cast him into Hell; <BR>32. `Then bind him with a chain, the length 
      of which is seventy cubits, <BR>33. `Verily, he did not believe in ALLAH, 
      the Great, <BR>34. `And he did not urge the feeding of the 
  poor.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
