    <TD>91. Who have pronounced the Qur'an to be so many lies. <BR>92. So by 
      the Lord, WE will, surely, question them all <BR>93. Concerning that which 
      they used to do. <BR>94. So declare openly that thou art commanded to 
      convey and turn aside from those who ascribe partners to ALLAH. <BR>95. WE 
      will, certainly, suffice thee against those who mock - <BR>96. Who set up 
      another god with ALLAH, but soon shall they come to know. <BR>97. And, 
      indeed, WE know that thy bosom becomes straitened because of what they 
      say. <BR>98. But glorify the Lord praising HIM, and be of those who 
      prostrate themselves before Him. <BR>99. And continue worshiping thy Lord 
      till death comes to thee. <BR>&nbsp;

      1. The decree of ALLAH is at hand, so seek ye not to hasten it. Holy is HE 
      and exalted far above all that which they associate with HIM. <BR>2. HE 
      sends down the angels with revelation by HIS command on whomsoever of HIS 
      servants HE pleases, saying, `Warn people that there is no god but I, so 
      take ME alone for your protector.' <BR>3. HE has created the heavens and 
      the earth in accordance with the requirements of wisdom. Exalted is HE far 
      above all that they associate with Him. <BR>4. HE has created man from a 
      mere drop of fluid, but lo ! he is an open disputer. <BR>5. And the cattle 
      too HE has created; and you find in them warmth and other uses; and of the 
      flesh of some of them you eat. <BR>6. And in them there is ornament and 
      dignity for you when you bring them home in the evening and when you drive 
      them forth to pasture in the 
morning.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
