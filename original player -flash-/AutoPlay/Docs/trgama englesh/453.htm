    <TD>1. Sad, WE cite as proof the Qur'an, which is full of exhortation, 
      that it is Our revealed Word. <BR>2. But those who disbelieve are steeped 
      in false pride and enmity. <BR>3. How many a generation have WE destroyed 
      before them ! they cried out for help, but it was no longer the time for 
      escape. <BR>4. And they wonder that a Warner has come to them from among 
      themselves; and the disbelievers say, `This is a sorcerer, a great liar. 
      <BR>5. `What ! has he made all the gods into one God ? This is, indeed, an 
      astounding thing.' <BR>6. And the leaders among them went about saying `Go 
      and stick to your gods. This is a thing to be desired; <BR>7. `We have not 
      heard of anything like this in any previous creed. This is nothing but a 
      forgery; <BR>8. `Has the reminder been sent down to him alone out of us 
      all ?' Nay, they are in doubt concerning MY Reminder. Nay, they have not 
      yet tasted MY punishment. <BR>9. Do they possess the treasures of the 
      mercy of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great Bestower ? <BR>10. Or, is theirs 
      the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them ? 
      Then let them ascend with the means at their disposal. <BR>11. They are a 
      host of the confederates which shall be routed here. <BR>12. Before them 
      too the people of Noah, and the tribe of Ad and Pharaoh, the Lord of 
      stakes, rejected the Messengers as liars; <BR>13. And the tribe of Thamud, 
      and the People of Lot, and the dwellers of the Wood - these were the 
      confederates too. <BR>14. Not one of them but treated their Messengers as 
      liars, so MY punishment justly overtook them. <BR>15. And these now wait 
      only for a single blast, and there shall be no delaying it. <BR>16. They 
      say, `O Lord, hasten to us our portion of the punishment before the Day of 
      Reckoning.' </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
