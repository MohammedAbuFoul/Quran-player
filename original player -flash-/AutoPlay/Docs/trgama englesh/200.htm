    <TD>80. Ask thou forgiveness for them, or ask thou not forgiveness for 
      them; even if thou ask forgiveness for them seventy times, ALLAH will 
      never forgive them. That is because they disbelieved in ALLAH and HIS 
      Messenger. And ALLAH guides not the perfidious people. <BR>81. Those who 
      contrived to be left behind rejoice in their sitting at home behind the 
      Messenger of ALLAH, and were averse to striving with their wealth and 
      their persons in the cause of ALLAH. And they said, `Go not forth in the 
      heat.' Say, `The fire of Hell is more intense in heat.' If only they could 
      understand. <BR>82. They should laugh little and weep much as a reward for 
      that which they used to earn. <BR>83. And if ALLAH bring thee back to a 
      party of them, they ask of thee leave to go forth to fight, say then, `You 
      shall never go forth with me, and shall never fight an enemy with me. You 
      chose to sit at home the first time, so sit now with those who remain 
      behind.' <BR>84. And never pray thou for any of them that dies, nor stand 
      by his grave; for they disbelieved in ALLAH and HIS Messenger and died 
      while they were disobedient. <BR>85. And let not their riches and their 
      children excite thy wonder; ALLAH only intends to punish them therewith in 
      this world and that their souls may depart while they are disbelievers. 
      <BR>86. And when a Surah is revealed, enjoining, `Believe in ALLAH and 
      strive in HIS cause in company with HIS Messenger,' men of wealth an 
      affluence among them ask leave of thee and say, `Leave us that we be with 
      those who sit at home.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
