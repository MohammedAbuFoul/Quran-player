    <TD>13. Do they say, `He has forged it ?' Say, `Then bring ten Surahs like 
      it forged, and call on whom you can apart from ALLAH, if you are 
      truthful.' <BR>14. And if they do not accept your challenge, then know 
      that it has been revealed comprising that which is only within ALLAH's 
      knowledge and there is no god but HE. Will you then submit. <BR>15. Whoso 
      desires the present life and its adornment, WE will fully repay them for 
      their works in this life and they shall not be wronged therein. <BR>16. 
      Those are they who shall have nothing in the Hereafter save the Fire, and 
      that which they wrought in this life shall come to naught, and vain shall 
      be that which they used to do. <BR>17. Can he, then, who stands upon a 
      clear proof from his Lord, and to testify to whose truth a witness from 
      HIM shall follow him, and who was preceded by the Book of Moses, a guide 
      and a mercy, be an impostor ? Those who are the true followers of Moses 
      believe therein, and whoever of the opposing parties disbelieve in it, the 
      Fire shall be his promised place. So be not thou, O reader, in doubt about 
      it. Surely, it is the truth from thy Lord; but most men believe not. 
      <BR>18. And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against ALLAH ? 
      Such shall be presented before their Lord, and the witness will all say, 
      `These are they who lied against their Lord.' Now, surely, the curse of 
      ALLAH is on the wrongdoers, <BR>19. Who turn men away from the path of 
      ALLAH and seek to make it crooked. And these it is who disbelieve in the 
      Hereafter.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
