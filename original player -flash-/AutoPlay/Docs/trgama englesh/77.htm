    <TD>1. O ye people ! fear your Lord who created you from a single soul and 
      of its kind created its mate, and from them twain spread many men and 
      women; and fear ALLAH, in Whose name you appeal to one another, and fear 
      him particularly respecting ties of kinship. Verily ALLAH watches over 
      you. <BR>2. And give to the orphans their property and exchange not the 
      bad for the good, and devour not their property by mixing it with your 
      own. Surely, it is a great sin. <BR>3. And if you fear that you will not 
      be just in dealing with the orphans, then marry of other women as may be 
      agreeable to you, two, or three, or four; and if you fear you will not be 
      able to do justice, then marry only one or marry what your right hand 
      possess. Thus it is more likely that you will not do injustice. <BR>4. And 
      give the women their dowries willingly. But if they, of their own 
      pleasure, remit to you a part thereof, then enjoy it as something pleasant 
      and wholesome. <BR>5. And give not to those weak of understanding your 
      property which ALLAH has made for you a means of support; but feed them 
      therewith and clothe them and speak to them words of kind advice. <BR>6. 
      And test the understanding of orphans until they attain the age of 
      marriage, then, if you perceive in them mature judgment, deliver to them 
      their property; and devour it not in extravagance and haste against their 
      growing up. And whoso is rich, let him abstain; and who so is poor let him 
      eat thereof with equity. And when you deliver to them their property, then 
      call witnesses in their presence. And ALLAH is sufficient as a Reckoner.
