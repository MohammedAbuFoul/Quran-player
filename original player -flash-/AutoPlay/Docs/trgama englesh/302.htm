    <TD>75. He replied, `Did I not tell thee that thou couldst never bear with 
      me patiently ?' <BR>76. Moses said, `If I ask thee concerning anything 
      after this, keep me not in thy company, for then thou shalt have got 
      sufficient excuse from me.' <BR>77. So they went on till, when they came 
      to the people of a town, they asked its people for food, but they refused 
      to receive them as their guests. And they found therein a wall which was 
      about to fall and he repaired it. Moses said, If thou hadst so desired, 
      thou couldst have taken payment for it.' <BR>78. He said, `This is the 
      parting of the ways between me and thee. I will tell thee the meaning of 
      that which thou wast not able to bear with patience; <BR>79. `As for the 
      boat, it belonged to certain poor people who worked on the sea and I 
      desired to damage it, for there was behind them a king who seized every 
      boat by force; <BR>80. `And as for the youth, his parents were believers, 
      and we feared lest on growing up he should involve them into trouble 
      through rebellion and disbelief; <BR>81. `So we desired that their Lord 
      should give them in exchange one better than he in purity and closer in 
      filial affection; <BR>82. `And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan 
      boys in the town, and beneath it was a treasure belonging to them, and 
      their father had been a righteous man, so thy Lord desired that they 
      should reach their age of full strength and take out their treasure, as a 
      mercy from thy Lord and I did it not of my own accord. This is the 
      explanation of that which thou could not bear with patience.' <BR>83. And 
      they ask thee concerning Dhu'l Qarnain. Say, `I will recite to you 
      something of his account.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
