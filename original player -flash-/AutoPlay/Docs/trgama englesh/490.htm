    <TD>11. And Who sends down water from the clouds in proper measure, and 
      WE, thereby, quicken a dead land - even so will you be raise - <BR>12. And 
      Who has created pairs of all things, and has made for you ships and cattle 
      whereon you ride, <BR>13. That you may sit firmly upon their backs, and, 
      then, when you are firmly seated thereon, you may remember the favour of 
      your Lord, and say, `Holy is HE Who has subjected these to us, and we were 
      not capable of subduing them ourselves, <BR>14. `And to our Lord, surely, 
      shall we return.' <BR>15. And they assign to HIM a part of HIS servants as 
      HIS children. Indeed man is manifestly ungrateful. <BR>16. Has HE taken 
      daughters from what HE has created, and favoured you with sons ? <BR>17. 
      Yet when the tidings are given to one of them of that the like of which he 
      ascribes to the Gracious God, his face becomes dark and he is choked with 
      inward grief. <BR>18. Do they assign to ALLAH one who is nurtured among 
      ornaments, and who is not able to give clear expression to an argument in 
      disputation ? <BR>19. And they regard as females the angels who are the 
      servants of the Gracious God. Did they witness their creation ? Then their 
      testimony will be recorded, and they will be questioned. <BR>20. And they 
      say, `If the Gracious God had so willed, we should not have worshiped 
      them.' They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but 
      conjecture. <BR>21. Have WE given them a Scripture before this, so that 
      they are holding fast to it ? <BR>22. Nay, but they say, `We found our 
      fathers following a certain course, and we are guided by their 
    footsteps.'&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
