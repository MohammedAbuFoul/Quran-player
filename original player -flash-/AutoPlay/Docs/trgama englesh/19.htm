    <TD>120. And the Jews will never be pleased with thee, nor the Christians, 
      unless thou followest their creed. Say `Surely ALLAH's guidance alone is 
      the true guidance,' And if thou follow their evil desires after the 
      knowledge has come to thee, thou shalt have from ALLAH, no friend nor 
      helper. <BR>121. They to whom we have given the Book, follow it as it 
      ought to be followed; it is these that believe therein. And whoso believes 
      not therein, these are they who are the losers.<BR>122. O Children of 
      Israel ! remember MY favours which I bestowed upon you, and that I exalted 
      you above all the nations of the time. <BR>123. And guard yourselves 
      against the day when no soul shall serve as a substitute for another soul 
      at all, nor shall any ransom be accepted from it, nor any intercession 
      avail it, nor shall it be helped.<BR>124. And remember when his Lord tried 
      Abraham with certain commandments which he fulfilled, HE said, `I will 
      make thee a leader of men.' Abraham asked, `And from among my offspring ?' 
      God said, `MY covenant does not embrace the transgressors.' <BR>125. And 
      remember the time when WE made the House a resort for mankind and a place 
      of security; We said, `Take ye the station of Abraham as a place of 
      prayer.' And we commanded Abraham and Ishmael, saying, `Purify MY House 
      for those who perform the circuit and for those who remain therein for 
      devotion and those who bow down and fall prostrate in Prayer.' <BR>126. 
      And remember when Abraham said, `My Lord, make this a town of peace and 
      provide with fruits such of its dwellers as believe in ALLAH and the Last 
      Day.' ALLAH said `And on him too who believes not, will I bestow benefits 
      for a little while; then will I drive him to the punishment of the Fire, 
      and an evil destination it 
is.&nbsp;</TD></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
