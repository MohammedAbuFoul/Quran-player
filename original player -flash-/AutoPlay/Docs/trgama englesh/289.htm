    <TD>67. And when harm touches you on the sea, all of those whom you call 
      upon, except HIM, are lost to you. But when HE brings you safe to land, 
      you turn aside; and man is very ungrateful. <BR>68. Do you then feel 
      secure that HE will not cause you to sink in the earth on the side of the 
      shore or send against you a violent sand-storm and then you will find no 
      guardian for yourselves ? <BR>69. Or, do you feel secure that HE will not 
      send you back therein a second time, and then send against you a 
      storm-blast, and drown you because of your disbelief ? You will then find 
      therein no helper for yourselves against US. <BR>70. Indeed, WE have 
      honoured the children of Adam, and WE carry them by land and sea, and 
      provide them with good things and have exalted them far above many of 
      those whom WE have created. <BR>71. Call to mind the day when WE shall 
      summon every people with their Leader. Then whoso shall be given his Book 
      in his right hand - such will read their book eagerly and they will not be 
      wronged a whit. <BR>72. But whoso is blind in this world shall be blind in 
      the Hereafter, and even more astray from the way. <BR>73. And they had 
      well-nigh caused thee severest affliction on account of what WE have 
      revealed to thee that thou mightest forge against US something other than 
      that; and they would have certainly taken thee for a special friend. 
      <BR>74. And if WE had not strengthened thee with the Qur'an even then thou 
      wouldst have inclined to them but a little. <BR>75. But if, as they 
      imagine, thou hast been one to forge a lie against US, then WE would have 
      made thee taste a heavy punishment in life and a heavy punishment in 
      death, and then thou wouldst not have found for thyself any helper against 
      US.&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
